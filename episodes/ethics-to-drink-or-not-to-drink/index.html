<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Welcome to this special live edition of front end Happy Hour podcast. We're speaking on Certified Fresh events, which is hosted by Brian Rinaldi. In this episode, we'll be talking about ethics in software engineering. Jem will actually be Leading today's discussion. Jem, do you want to kick it off?


<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
My name is Jem Young. I'm a senior software engineer here at Netflix, and we are live here at Netflix. And I want to talk about something that I think is really important in software engineering that we don't talk about a lot, which is ethics. Maybe 1020 years ago, when you're getting a CS degree. And ethics class was actually required learning for everybody getting becoming a software engineer. No longer is that the case. In fact, many software engineers don't have CS degrees, which is absolutely fine. But in doing that, we lost that ability to have that kind of moral compass moral foundation that I think a lot of the early pioneers in computer software had. But we've kind of lost that a bit along the way. And I wanted to have a panel with a lot of the smartest people that I know, talk about the current and future state of ethics in software engineering. So like I said, my name is Jem Young. I'm a senior software engineer here at Netflix. Ron, you wanna good?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix. Name's Augustus Yuan.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I'm a front end engineer at Evernote.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
I'm Ryan in club, and I'm a software engineer here at Netflix as well.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I'm Stacy London. I'm a senior front end engineer at Atlassian. And I'm

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Marge Julian. I'm a senior software engineer at Netflix as well.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
But to open up the panel, what is software engineering? What does ethics and software engineering mean? Relative to say other fields, so a doctors have the Hippocratic Oath, do no harm, things like that. Civil engineers have their own notes they write about because they make bridges and buildings and things like that. But software engineering doesn't really have an official kind of oath or mantra that we try to adhere to. So what is the state of ethics in software engineering? What does it mean?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Well, I think that's the thing is, I don't think there's a definition of it, I think that there's, you know, you spoke to doctors or civil engineers, and in software development or software engineering, we don't really actually have a set guidelines or anything, and I'm sure each company may have those, but not necessarily in our industry.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
So I did some research because I I myself didn't off the top of my head know if if Software Engineering has any official ethics definitions for industry, and it looks like there is the IEEE ca or Computer Society did define something. But the fact that that exists, maybe and we don't, you know, I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
didn't know you didn't know about it. Right? Like that's concerning.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah. But it has some definitions, which I found pretty interesting.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Awesome. What was the high level things that you found in there, um, it

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
was just a lot of stuff about how you interact with various entities. So like yourself, your co workers, your colleagues, society, as a whole your employer, and like, what it means to maybe do no harm or be a good, a good person to other people that you work with. It kind of defines those structures.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think what's interesting, too, and those principles that you're mentioning is, if you look at them, they're ordered, or if that intentional, yeah, yeah. So I mean, they're there. I don't know if they're ordered intentionally. But it may be in terms of priority, but the first one that elicits a public interest, and then directly after that is your clients and employer. So the idea that, like our business needs of our companies and the ones that we work for, and another skill sets that we're using, are always going to be we always have to consider the public interest at the same time, and perhaps as the primary Yeah, I

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
guess a common and this is by no means official, but I guess one common one that I do hear from people is saying like do right by our users. I think for a lot of like tech companies, like the focus is on what can we do for our users that, um, that are using our product? And how can we like respect what they want. So I think like big topics, like data privacy, like definitely come up when it comes to ethics. I think that's like one of the most common ones. I'm sure there are many others

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Atlassian, one of the company values is don't ask the customer. And that's in writing. And I love this. It's it's pretty

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
well defined.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
A bold statement, very bold.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So I'm glad that IEEE has a software engineering manifesto. I think there's a few of them out there. One of the issues is one. Ethics in software is completely relative because unlike most fields, which have some sort of ethical code are what we do like is everywhere. It's every field. It's not just medicine, or science or math or something like it's every single industry out there. So when people say, what's the public good, like Can Can someone explain that a bit for me? Like what does that mean? And then who? Who's the public? In this case? What if you work for the government? Is it do the government better than your customers? Or no one said it's gonna be easy.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, the government, I don't know if there, it'd be still like the public, the public using that it depends on the identity, I guess at that point is like what's like, what are you building? Like who's using it? I think it just comes down to the users. And the user could be people within the government, but it could also be public facing. So I guess what it comes down to, for me as users, that's who we should be cared about caring about and defining who are our users? And who like, what are we doing right by our users. And that could be that could vary in different cases. Like, depending on what you're building,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I suppose an interesting thing with defining that is, if the users are people, you are unexpected. So like, if you have like a site that's totally public, and you don't control who comes to your site at all, like it could be anybody in the world. Maybe that changes how you think about the ethics of your practices, or how you build things versus where it's a closed group and maybe unknown groups, maybe you're building like internal software that internal your your users are like internal to the company, maybe that changes things, maybe it doesn't. But I think that's maybe an interesting thing to think about.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
I think, really interesting question. For me, whenever I think of ethics in software is the people building self driving cars, right? The user is the driver of the car for the most part. But what happens if it comes into a situation where steer off a cliff? Or you know, run over some people? Right? It's the classic trolley, trolley car problem.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
One, it's not just the driver. It's everyone else? Everyone. That's it near or around that vehicle? So yeah, that's a very good one. I like that. Yeah, actually,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
one of my picks a long time ago was the so called Moral machine where you train, like, gives you scenarios of self driving car. And if it has to choose between like a pregnant lady and like a dog, like you choose who it hits, and it like train, it's, it's kind of dark,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think, even in the case of the self driving cars thing, but there's always you have to consider the business as well, like that's, I think, when you're training the models as self driving cars use everyone's always, you know, refers to the oh, you know, the least harm done. But then the other question on the flip side, when you take into account the businesses who's going to buy a self driving car that's going to drive you off a cliff? And I think that's like in software engineering, this is a really, I think this is a great question, because it brings into, like really clear view of the dilemmas that we face. Because for the business, you need to make a car that people are gonna buy, but you also need to make a car that people feel comfortable having on the road. And those perspectives are completely different depending on what what part of like if you're outside the car, if you're in the car, like who you are relative to that car. And I just think that's such an interesting problem. Because it's like right in front of you. These are the issues. These are the types of dilemmas that we're dealing with, or at least in that industry, perhaps not in streaming. But

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
that's a good example of the self driving cars. I think. Ethics in software engineering is about going the extra mile and protecting the user above all like this in Tron one of the one of the great movies, like I fight for the user. Ideally, we all think that but the truth is we don't, because there are people out there that write spam bots, there are people out there that write those pop under ads, there are people out there that write super cookies. There's a lot of hostile software engineers in the world. So one thing I really want to talk about was dispelling this myth of Silicon Valley in this like Halo that we all do good all the time. It's just not true. There are people out there that write things that I think morally we would all disagree with. So my question is, how do you tow that line between? I need to make money I need to make a career but also I disagree with what my company is doing? Like, essentially, everybody has a price. How do you determine where that is? How do you determine when is too far? What is like this? This hostile to the user, but it's good for the business? Oh, yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
he's was a tough sell. Do it on Tuesday.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think we're gonna go with something

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I was gonna get it

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
definitely requires a drink. Yeah, that's, that's tough. I think like to me. I don't know where to draw the line. I think it's a case by case. But I think you should feel comfortable pushing back on things and really questioning whether it be coming from leadership or where are these things coming from and and question it if you feel uncomfortable, I think you should be questioning. I don't think that's really answering your question, Jem. But I think that it's really case by case and I think at that point, you shouldn't just take it for what it is. If you feel uncomfortable, something you should absolutely be questioning it.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I think that's it's tricky. Let's get like the you can get into things like I'm the sole provider for my family. If I lose my job, I lose my insurance. My kid has medical needs that would be untenable without medical insurance. Those things have just In a lot of people's behavior, because you might, people might put up with more than their ethical line draws for them because they're scared. And their livelihood is at stake. So things like that can actually like blur people's judgement because of you know, fear, you know, if your Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs isn't met, like those are things that really drive decisions that maybe aren't, you know, the most bold decisions, they're, they're ones out of fear.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I'll actually even add to that, I love that you said like sole provider, that kind of aspect. Luckily, I have a green card now, but I was once on a visa, right and working visa, and that's tied to a company. And that's like, you know, if I get let go, I've pretty quick turnaround that I need to find another job, or I'm going back to Canada. So that that can be another issue is like, if you're pushing back too hard, then are you going to lose your job for that. And I can see that that might blur the line a little bit more.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Not that it's good or bad. But it's just something I think that that does influence how people decide to be ethical or not.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So I'll say a real potential scenario, that something has software engineers, any of us could be in. Let's say, God forbid, you had a child and they have a heart condition they need to transplant, you as software engineer have access to that database, you could theoretically move your child to the top of the list, and no one ever know, because you control that you you own that entire system. When you think about things like that, you have to think really hard about what does ethics mean, in that terms? Where's your line? Exactly. But that's just one example of the power. We have software engineers that we just don't think about this impact we have that we could do if we wanted to.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I guess with that example, though, like if we go with the ethics of do no harm and harm to others, you potentially are harming a lot of other potential also helping someone to that that's true. I'm not saying I know, I look, Ali, jeez,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
do we have a keyword?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Jam miss that and I'm like, Man, I usually

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
usually scream a keyword to just have a reason to drink, but

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
so that that was maybe too, too personal. But that could be accurate for any vote for any of us. And we could be in that position someday, hopefully not. But let's extrapolate that out larger. So instead of a child, it's your company and your company is about to go under, you're a startup, you're hustling, you have the ability to maybe steal some competitors secrets that would give you an edge at that point, years, 200 people at this company. And this is like some mega Corp that won't even notice that these secrets are gone. So when you look at it in those terms, which again, are real scenarios, we could be in a software engineers, where's the ethical line? How do you know? When is too far? When is the good of the many outweigh the good of the few?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Think you're like looking for a solid answer here? And I don't think there is like I truly don't.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
And that's, that's my opinion, there is no right answer. But I want to hear some some thoughts.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, I think it's all dependent on the circumstance. But I mean, I don't have an answer for you. And it's

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
also a slippery slope as well, right. So if you steal that trade information, that trade secret into your company, then that fosters that right from the very beginning. Now from that point forward. Everything you do is gonna be based off of, you know, not your own intelligence, not your own proprietary information. So now your company, everything forward is kind of almost built off a lie.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Sometimes some businesses are built off patents, like something you just stole. So that can be another issue. But

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Ryan, you hit the nail on the head there. To me, there is no right answer. Obviously, in like moral philosophy, there is no right answer, unless you subscribe to a particular school. However, these are just things I think, as software engineers, we should think about because we have this unprecedent power never before in history of like, so few people have the ability to change the world. But we've never once thought like, what's the extent of that power? Should you think about the limits? Should we think about self imposed limits on things we can do? For me, it's important just to have thought about it, at least at some point.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I think engineers have a lot of power or more power than they think. As an example, I think Google a bunch of engineers spoke up and said, We don't feel comfortable with the particular software being used for you know, x. And and they changed the course of that a little bit. And I think that's that was really powerful story. And I think, if maybe if you're worried about you know, standing up for something and losing your job, because it's, it's hard for you to lose your job for many reasons. At least, maybe you can talk to your co workers and you have a cohort, a group that could stand together on something that you feel passionate about, and I think there's some power there with like numbers and you can say no in groups,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
when I'd honestly I'd rather be shipped back to Canada than like to stand up for something I believe in. I would definitely do it. But I can see why sometimes people may not want to do that. I like the idea of just trying to silicate those conversations and just don't go silent. I think that to me is the biggest important thing is like, bring it up, raise the concern. If the company doesn't agree and they still want to move forward, then it's fine you to really decide Do you stay at that company?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
I think you just turned yourself into a Nike name, stand for something, just do it, even if it makes you get shipped back to Canada. All right.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
But but in tougher engineering specially because at least in the States and parts of Europe, were some of the highest paid people out there. So the moral dilemma is real because we have a choice between money and doing what we feel is right. And often I feel like we choose the money, and we just kind of like push aside our moral qualms. So it's more like, in general, what's the best way to get people to think about the ethics of the things that they do the things they build?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, I'd even be interested in some examples of like, Where have we actually faced some of these things within some of the code that we're doing? Like, what are some areas that, you know, maybe you felt a little bit weird, Jem, you mentioned, like, building popup ads or building ads? Is that? Is that really bad? Like, you know, some, someone may actually feel that that's okay. But that's, you know, they're they're doing their job and building mechanism to promote other products. And, you know, we may not find that great, but that could actually be okay. So I'm interested to know, like others on the panel, what are some things that we've created along the way that maybe felt weird? Or maybe you've pushed back on maybe left the company because of that?

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Well, I mean, I didn't create, but I feel like one example that kind of stands out. And, um, you know, Uber has definitely changed a lot these past few years. So I'm not trying to take jabs at them. But there was this like article about how this interviewer came to, like, interview with the CEO, or site, some high executive, and they came down immediately when her Uber, like, stopped at the building. She was like, Oh, how did you know that I arrived, he's like, Oh, I was like, looking at you, you know, on this, like, god mode? This? If we haven't linked to the article, well, I'm sure we'll link it. And yeah, I'm sure like, and this, like, example, kind of stands out to me, because it's like, I'm sure someone coded it. And probably like the intentions weren't for, you know, some executive to go look, God Mode at whoever they wanted. Maybe there was like, some actual reasons for like, you know, customer support needed to find, like, you lost your cell phone, and they needed to track and you knew the last Uber, they could help you with your permission and something like that. Like there's like justifications for that. But it's definitely tough, right? Like, how do you like, know, as a, as someone who's like, programming it like, what the intention is? Will it will be used for all the time upfront?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, there's some interest like with the software that Atlassian makes, it's very meta, it's meta software to make other to make other pieces of software. So are there companies that are using you know, our software to make bad things? Maybe? You don't know? Because often you don't, you don't know all the customers that are using your thing. And even if you build your things with good intention, and an ethical standards, people could use your software to do things that are not ethical. And that's kind of hard. I've struggled with that. I think like, how do I balance that I know that I think I'm working on something that's very ethical, or my standards are never being challenged, but who someone else using the thing that I built is, and that's, that's kind of a tough one. I've,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
like you're building API's for someone else to leverage and you're like, I don't know what they're gonna do with this. But I'm still creating these API's. It's not really your fault if they're used malicious, but they could be

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, but it's something to think about that, you know, it sits in the back of your brain.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
They're an example of, I think the times when a company I worked for did the morally ethically right thing was it was a subscription service, and you get a free trial or whatever. And the choice was to either alert the user to let them know that, hey, we're about to start billing you and or to not alert them and just silently build them. And I've seen companies do it both ways. And fortunately, the company I was at, decided to not or to send the email, let you know, like, Hey, we're about to bill you. But there are examples audible.com, I'm calling you out of people of companies that will sign you up for service and then silently bill you for as long as possible, and even not notify you as much as possible to that you're being billed. That to me is like an unethical it's like it's pretty clear what's right and wrong. But again, at the bottom line, if you have to feed your family, at what point do you say like no, this is this is too much. This is this is not right.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, it actually feed into that on the opposite. Or you talking about the positive of emailing someone say, Hey, your subscription or you're going to be billed for this. I've worked at a company where it's kind of similar. It wasn't really a subscription base, I guess it was in the sense that you're paying for added features. And there's this point where we were actively not emailing customers that were paying, they were inactive like they weren't using the product. And instead of like sending the marketing emails or anything like they would be removed from the list, just almost To not remind them is like you're getting billed for this. So shady and, and I felt like that That, to me felt really wrong. And then in the flip side of it is like having a subscription where it's like, hey, you know, you have this free trial, just a reminder, you will get billed is kind of nice because I've been there I've I once paid for a service that Microsoft had I was paying for it for like, it's my own bad I paid for it like a good year or two without really realizing it was so small, it was on my credit card that I didn't really notice the line item. And I never used the product, but like was continuing to build it. And I never saw any like a reminder, any melons, like that's on me a little bit for not paying attention to like the byline on my visa statement. But still, I mean, that kind of sucked

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
by not favorite. But I think a well known example is there 25 self familiar to anybody there 20. So it's one of the clear cut cases where bad programming has killed somebody. So they're 25 in the 80s was a kind of a radiation machine, it would do targeted radiation. And it turned out the software engineer or software engineers, there's a race condition in there, where the machine would just keep bombarding the person with radiation because it didn't know how to stop because there's a race condition and literally killed somebody. So that's an instance of like, there are downstream consequences of let's say, not doing enough QA and not doing enough testing. But again, we have to balance that with the real life, we need to ship things as well. Is there an instance where you're like, I'm unsure about the scenario, there could be consequences, but I need to get out the door. Anyways. I know I've been in several that I've been talking this whole time. So

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
yeah, I mean, I think there's like the that stupid mantra go fast and break things or whatever. Right? Like, I don't like that.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, I think Facebook literally had that. But they've since changed that. While Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
but when like the break things is like break humans, like, don't do it test more.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
One, I guess into that point is like Facebook, I mean, okay, all right. There, they could break the fact that you can't like post something on Facebook. But we've now relied on something like Facebook, Twitter, text messages, and all these things have become so important that breaking something for your users can actually lead to an emergency like where I'm like needing to get ahold of you, Stacy, because of XY and Z happened. And I can't because something's broken, that that could actually be very problematic. At first, I'd be like, well, it's it's not the end of the world. It's just social media. But we've now turned to really rely on these so that that can be an even bigger problem,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think even like to move fast and break things point. It's, it can be more insidious, as well. Because when you say move fast and break things, a lot of times people use that as an excuse for growth. But it's not so much you I mean, yes, there are consequences for more serious products where you might break people or or to that effect. But other companies like Facebook and Instagram that build bad habits over time, because they're growing their user base are really trying to get you hooked on social media at almost to the point of being addictive. And that's part of the move fast break things, the breaking is less obvious. But I think that there's still kind of a duty to users to consider the ramifications that this has on their life, like how, what are the habits that you're building? Or what are the habits that you're breaking? Are there good habits that you're breaking? Are they bad habits that you're creating? And I think that's not something we talk about a lot, but move fast break things means growth and growth isn't always healthy for us?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Is it cool? Or is it okay to be building something that people are addicted to?

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think I mean, I think it's that's a really hard question. I think we all the obviously is

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
and I'm a big fan of sitting on Instagram or like Twitter, I love it. Like when I'm bored or just like waiting for someone or like, anything like that I'm on there. And is that good? I don't know. Actually, it's

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
true. And one thing that I kind of want to give a big shout out to is like for Google and Apple like they've started like, including like things to see how much time you spend on the phone. I think like Android announced that Google IO like they're announcing this thing which will like tell you like how often you're on your phone. And I'll even like alert you to like, not be on your phone so much. So I think like those kind of ethics. Yeah, I think they definitely play a big role. And like, it's good to see some like tech companies starting to like, address that in their own

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
ways. Yeah, I mean, iOS 12 released today, and that has some of those features in there to actually monitor and or you don't have to use it, but it tells you that you're using it your devices too much. It has like parent controls in there for your kids, which I think yes, those should have been there a long time ago. I'm glad to see that. So it is nice to see some of these options there opt in, which is fine, too. I don't I don't think that's a problem. If you know if I'm addicted to Instagram and I enjoy it, I guess. Well, I'm going to keep using it so that

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I'll give a devil's advocate like what gives private companies the moral authority to tell me what I can and cannot do if like let's say good willsez using the phone is using my phone too long, too much like we just think it's bad for you, we're gonna automatically shut down your phone after certain amount of time like, but

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think that's what they're doing. They're They're not our sorry, they're not doing that they're giving you the opt in. So

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
take it one step further. Yeah, where a company could do that if they want to see PID.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
But why? Why would they want to do that? They could. I mean, I would not like that at all.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Nobody cares what you billion trillion dollar companies like they can impose these things at will. But what if, collectively, all the engineers and product managers say like, We're doing this for the public good? Kids game too much. So we want to cut off their gaming time? Like, is it in their purview? Is it in our purview to say that? Or is it let people first amendment like you do whatever you want? Because you're an adult, or you're an independent person,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I look at as on the individual, I think like giving those controls and setting that tone is super helpful, and they shouldn't be there. But no, I don't think that I don't think it's the company's job to set that tone or decide that hey, Stacy, you've been watching too much Netflix or you've been playing too many video games like in shut it off for you. I think it's it's more having those mechanisms are helpful and those controls, but I don't think it's really on them to decide what people are doing.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Does it come down to like ethics and software engineering as a matter of just transparency, in terms of in terms of using these products, like, you know, iOS 12 gives us the information about the different products that we're using, but hey, I'm still addicted to Instagram. I know, I spent hours on it every week, I still use it. But at least now I know that because iOS 12 told me. And that comes down to transparency. I think I mean, what I'm hearing, at least what you guys are saying is that now we have the information. But we don't think that companies have the should have the ability to make that decision. But at least they're giving us the information. And if more of them did that and were more transparent. Perhaps there's the morality in software engineering, or part of it, the beginning of

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
it. I like the transparency. I think you've hit it right. Yeah, I feel I love that. That's a good way to put it. Is that just being transparent and saying like, Yeah, I'm cool with the amount of times I use that app. But yeah, that's cool. Thanks for servicing it, but I'm still gonna keep going. Or I might question go, oh, wow, I should probably do something else. Well, the

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
tool exists. I mean, without the tool, we would have no idea and we wouldn't be able to make the decisions for ourselves. But I don't know is that the beginning?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So I, I understand where you're coming from, I disagree. Transparency being like, that's the solution. For instance, end user license agreements, everything is buried in there, like someone there, you could be like, Ryan, you just you just signed over your child, you didn't even know if you clicked I didn't know it. But like, there are people that are comfortable and plenty, lots of companies do it are comfortable with saying like, well, the user could have read that. And they didn't. But we're being as transparent as possible. It literally says, We will sell your data to everybody. And people are like, oh, yeah, we click OK. But like, and that's what I want to get to, like, the core of ethics is like, where's the line? You You're saying, like, I informed the user, therefore I am absolved of all responsibility. But that's, that's just not true. In so many cases,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think informing your you're saying almost like hidden tax, because I'm sorry, but like, no one reads the Terms of Use. So I think companies know that. But having a feature that, like iOS 12, let's pick on that, because it's it literally a just released today is they're calling out as a feature, they're actually trying to be very transparent and sell it as a feature that these new controls are there. I believe when you upgrade, it even kind of talks about that in there. And so I think that, to me, is more transparent than putting it in some like hidden data line that we're gonna sell your data. I think companies at that point that is unethical, it's like they're literally trying to hide that from you. And they're saying, Well, you agreed, but you had to agree to move forward, like you had to agree to sign up for this, or you had to agree to use this product, whatever it is. And so that seems a little bit less transparent. I think, to Mars's point, it's more transparent in the sense that we're demonstrating this, we're showing you that, Hey, there's this data that you're using, you're using this product a lot just surfacing this. So you know, and then you can choose what to do. But I think the hidden taxes, yes, maybe that fits into that unethical part.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Maybe it's like visible, intentional transparency. But that's

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
so relative that is so relative, boy would argue the End User License Agreement is completely transparent, invisible, you can scroll and read and it's

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
like, alright, if it wasn't in like 10 point font, and even if it was like in 25.5, who knows that legal jargon, it is not easy to read. And so that to me, is there. There's still hidden language in there. And nobody's going to read that.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So I'll post a question to Ryan, because I know you work on TV. Often you work on TV UI. Let's say you create a new feature. And the user, like you have to click through it because I bought this TV. I have to click through so we act like there's a choice. A lot of times we're like, Yo, you clicked okay. But oftentimes, there's no choice. There's Android and there's Apple There's there's not much but I still need a phone, I still need to find the function. So like, Ryan, TV is a good example. Because I know there is software out there that like will track the users track their watching habits, things like that it's built into the TV. You can't use it the TV without using that software.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And it's outside of the applications. Like if I'm watching like Amazon or Hulu or Netflix, it's outside of that.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah. And I know Ryan, I, og, Ryan, Ryan, UCLA, we've had discussions on things like this before, what's the question? The question is like, how do you how do you balance? Like we say, oh, users have a choice, but not necessarily. It's like the illusion of choice, you have to click except

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
with the TV example. Right, there is a choice. And I think the company that you're talking about that was tracking this stuff, you know, that came out. And it was a very public issue for that manufacturer. And I think people chose to go a different way. Right. And your phones thing, I think the market will correct a lot of those things where a company is doing something shady, or is limiting something that doesn't give the users power, right. So let's say it's Android versus iOS, and they both decide to limit you your use of particular applications. I think the market would still correct that I think there's other manufacturers out there, people could start using future phones again, right, and stop staring at screens and start spending time with their family a little bit more. I think market will generally, you know, take care of violently, or very, very unethical companies. Right. So

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think it goes back to similar points that were made earlier to is that like, I think, Stacy, you talked about even with internally, people being vocal on things or like getting together as a group, well, if a company is doing something that's like, feels unethical and wrong, as a group on the internet, as a community, we can absolutely change and shift that as like people choose not to buy something, they you know, we do have options. And you're right, if Android and iOS both go in one direction, well, that just opens the door for a new company to be created, and hopefully correct that

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
you actually wanted to. So I actually thought the terms and condition was like a really good example. And I was like, Oh, that's a great example of like, transparency. But and the thing that kind of irks me about it, because I think it's a super valid point, it is the company being transparent, but they're being transparent to cover their own asses like they're there. It's like to cover liability. It's not for the intention of hey, users, you should know about all this stuff, right? This is more of like, Hey, don't sue us. Here's some formal written documentation. Like there are some companies that have started doing this thing where they'll take their terms and conditions, and then they'll make them like, the like, summarize them in like very human friendly, human friendly. I was I was like, non lawyer, I was like, How would I describe myself? Because my intelligence isn't like that of a human but no.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Just setting is like 
really low.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
So literally search showing source code for most users? Yeah, be like, that's not really useful to majority people.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I'm glad you brought up source code. So a few weeks ago, there was an incident where a fairly public and prolific JavaScript library author he, this person created a new license, where they said, any of these companies that are working with immigration and customs enforcement cannot use my software because I disagree morally, with their stance. And because I wrote the software, it is within my rights to say that. What is everybody's thoughts on something like that?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, it is right. It's like, buddies. It depends. Was it open source before? Yeah, yeah, they're not like, it's kind of tough to like, claw it back. But I think if if I've created something myself, I have the right to open source that I have the right to share that with maybe just you gem, or this panel. I don't know, that's really tough, though, when it's been open source, and then you're clawing at back, that might be very difficult.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I was gonna say, it takes a lot of courage to do that. So I just want to kind of give a shout out for that. I think it takes a tremendous amount of courage to like, kind of like, take your software that's helping many people, many people probably depend on it. And then you just shut it off to like, stand up for something that you truly believe in. So lots of respect for that. Whether it's ethical, yeah, like, I think opens the app. Actually, I'm really glad that kind of happened because it started a lot of conversations about open source, and a lot of ethics. Like, how involved does open source get into it? And I actually agree with Ryan like, it is kind of awkward, because like, they kind of licensed it, but then like because it was open source before pretty much old iterations are still available. So it's not necessarily like it's not going to solve the problem per se, but actually, but if the intention which I actually this is what I believe it was for if the intention is to like make it like known, like, like call out, like these kinds of things, then it really did its job very well. So

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
now I'm just gonna actually pose another question that kind of goes back to one of the earlier points I made about, you know, surgeons need to be certified engineers need to be certified, you know, there's a process to software engineering need a certification process. You know, it doesn't need to be as specialized as different verticals within software engineering, have their own different code of ethics, that and certification process that people need to go through?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
That's a great question.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think it's I mean, I think largely, it's in the context of what you are a software engineer, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but there are certifications, if you're working in certain high, like, touch, I guess, areas, like, you know, you're developing software for airplane guidance, or, you know, NASA or drones, you know, that kind of thing. And I think that does. I mean, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm, I'm pretty sure that that exists. But what's interesting is that like software engineering, like everything now is online and software engineering as an as a profession. And the industry has grown so much, that I guess no one really saw the need for it, we were sort of just building tools quickly that were useful without considering the ramifications. And with no formal process in place, which one I think is the beauty of software engineering, but too, it does pose some problems.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
It it's a it's a yin yang, because it software is open, anybody become a software engineer tomorrow. But the problem is anybody can come a software engineer tomorrow, whether or not they're qualified, I'll stay away from self driving cars, because I wasn't an easy target. But let's say banking software, let's say I push a bug. People can't log into their their bank account, somewhere 10s of 1000 people out there can't close a house. They can't like pay their mortgage, because I pushed a small bug. So maybe there should be some sort of certification. But again, like I don't know what that would give us.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
The mistake could still happen,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
let me say could still happen. Yeah, yeah, I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
think that's for me is like we still ship bugs, no matter how great we are. That's why we have QA that's why a job exists. And that's why you need to check everything. And no matter how many certifications are done, it's still gonna happen. Maybe it happens less, maybe.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
It's interesting, because like, there's like having a software engineer level. But then also, I feel there are some ethics on like the product level, like one thing that I've kind of thought about was like ride sharing apps. And like, on one hand, they provide tons of jobs for people who are crowdsourcing, but then it takes away a lot of jobs from like, taxis and stuff like Airbnb takes away a lot. Maybe competing with hotels and stuff. And I think there has been some ethical, like moral conversations of if that's right. And then I think the government has kind of stepped in to try to like, mitigate, try to make the balance, kind of. Okay, but that's always also been something that's, I've never really,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
what do you think of it? What's your opinion? I definitely to take away the jobs of taxi drivers and hotels,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
it's it's tough. Like, I don't know, I'm a, like, I'm a huge fan of open source. And therefore I'm kind of a huge fan of crowdsourcing, I feel like by the people, if people want to do something, and there's something that can set it up for them. Like, it's literally like, if I wanted to call my friend and pay him like a few bucks to pick me up, like Uber and Lyft have just made an app to just kind of do that. And I think it's awesome to like, just meet new people who like, want to, like, try it, try it out and stuff. But yeah, I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
think, I think for me, it was literally taking these old school business models, and putting a spin on it and saying, like, hey, there's more room for competition. And to me, some of the regulations that are coming in hotter. No, I I questioned that a little bit, too, is like, where's the money coming to support the regulations? Is it coming from these old school businesses? Maybe? Maybe not. But so I struggle with that one a little bit,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I think there's. So I've been reading a book about moral psychology. And there's a quote in there that I thought was really fascinating, that kind of relates to this. And it says, like, the most important principle for designing an ethical society is to make sure that everyone's reputation is on the line and all the time or all the time, so that bad behavior will always bring bad consequences. And I think sometimes the market is that correction. But also, maybe sometimes the market doesn't correct it. And maybe that's government. And so that that's where those lines get a little blurry. But I think if they're, you know, we asked about, you know, certifications, I think that's just like, if you break your certification, you break your moral and ethical code, there's a consequence for that. And I think that might consequences at multiple levels. I guess.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
We almost need more consequences at that point.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I think there are a lot of consequences. I think that's maybe what holds the fabric of an ethical society together and some of its market some of its government, and it's the balance between all those that has created the fact that we have society and that we can, you know, continue on as a human. Maybe that's a reason why diversity in your group of like in diversity in tech matters, because maybe if you had people that maybe had come here from different countries, and had perspective on what the culture was in their country and how it might affect people that live where they live like that would have come up sooner, maybe I mean, those things matter.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Diversity is not just within individual contributors. Its diversity and leadership. Like I think that would absolutely change some perspectives. And like to Mars's point, the individual contributor may not really understand the full picture, which hopefully to the transparency comment they do, because that really helps. But that's not always the case. But yeah, diversity super important at that point.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
That's an excellent point, Stacy. And it's a good segue into the Yes, diversity is important diversity of thought. People think differently from you. Because a lot of times software engineers, we have this perspective on the world. But especially here in Silicon Valley, it's a very American, US centric perspective on how things should be. And we don't take account, you know, the other 7.7 billion people around the planet, but we just impose that our thoughts and beliefs on people without thinking. And again, like Ryan said earlier, there are no easy answers. It's more, what I really want people to take away from this is that to have just like, think a little bit critically about the things you're building, and it's hard to imagine a long term consequences, but there are and like every line of code, or like, someone's relying on that, and it can alter their life one way or the other. Yeah, it sounds like we're high and mighty are these great software engineers that build things but the truth is like, we touch people's lives every day, like in a real way, so it's something we really need to think about carefully.
