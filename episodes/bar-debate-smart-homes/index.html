<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right, welcome to a brand new episode of Front End happier podcasts. If you've listened to previous episodes, you've likely heard snippets of Gemini PD disagreeing a little bit on smart homes or IoT products. So we thought why not do a special episode dedicated to debating smart homes? IoT, all the fun Wi Fi devices? Let's get introductions of today's panelists. It is really just Gemini. But Jem

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
started off Jem Young engineering manager at Netflix.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm an engineering manager at Netflix and each episode of the front end happier podcast, we'd like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all, in the episode, we will all take a drink. What did we decide gem network? Network? Alright, so if we say network, which I'm assuming we will probably it will come up, we will take a drink. I thought it started off, Jem. I know like I personally have always been fairly excited about home smart home devices, mainly because I like the ability that I can control things around the house from anywhere. So if I'm not home, or whatever it is, like I can control it. If I leave my lights on in my car and turn them off for oh, did I lock the door? Oh, it's locked. Or even just the automation part. I love all that. Like just being able to make things easier that just things just happen the time of day things change. That's been my mentality. But I also want to recognize, and I think we've made jokes about this on previous episodes is not everything needs to be connected. Not every little thing that is like, hey, why not throw a Wi Fi on that and make it smart? It doesn't need that. Or there's things where I'm like, why? So I do stand behind some of that. But I am very curious to hear your thoughts around. What do you think about smart homes? And you know, you've, you've maybe been on a little bit different side of the fence.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So I'll start off with, I'm not anti technology. I am in some of your hearts. But we'll dig into that a little later. I'll put it this way. So right other than schooling, and any education you've had, what qualifies you to make software? Learning certification? Sir,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
no, no, definitely

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
not an oversight board who's like double checking your work or? Nope. So they're in their lives. My problem with connected technology, there's no rigor put into a lot of devices that you end up counting on. So your Smart Lock, for instance, who who audits the security behind that? How do I know I can't just drive by with a router and a Bluetooth scramble or something and hack into your smart home? You don't know. And the problem is I know. And we know about software and we know about there's all levels of engineers, there's really, really good ones, there's really really bad ones everywhere in between. And there's no guarantee about this person who's making this life saving device for your or safety device for your house is a good software engineer, you have no way of proving that. And increasingly, I see more and more crappy software pushed out. Because it's super cheap these days, like connected devices. Raspberry Pi's, like anybody can build a smart home thing, put up a nice package, sell them on Instagram, boom, you got it, you have a smart home device, but it's backed by nothing you don't know if it was like packaged up by some Russian hackers and put put into a nice box with an American company and a smiling lady on the package. You don't know any of this stuff. And that's that's one aspect is like, the rigor behind these devices. There's a lot. The second part is there's no support. There's no There's no enforcement from the government or any agency that says like, Hey, I just spent $1,000 wiring up my mind if I see some smart hub that it's going to work in a year from now or two years from now. Heck, we seen it from Google where it's like, oh, by the way, we're gonna end up like this product there's literally a website I think it's called like Google graveyard or something with all the products they've killed over the years out of nowhere. It just stopped working that's not the that's not what I want. I want reliability everything we have in our house like from the electricity to the water to even though the house itself all has been through permitted through people that are license has spent years in their craft. Why? Because we've learned these lessons from house fires and collapses and like all these other things, yet, it's like we forgotten all that when it comes to technology. It's like hey, this this guy who's selling something on the street Yeah, that's good enough for me put let me put in my house. So that's my and my anti Smart Home rants. Ryan Burgess with the rebuttal.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Oh, that's good. I mean, I I follow some of what you're saying. And I don't disagree, but I do in the sense that I think that there's, you know, we pick on Google which is fair, they add to life things and that is is bad, but I also look at is I trust Google putting in more effort. And granted, they're going to make mistakes all the companies do. But I'm going to trust that buying something like the nest products or Google back product, they're putting more effort into security and thinking about those things, then yeah, your typical thing that you bought off Craigslist, or, you know, whatever, like Russian site that you're talking about, Jem, there's a little more to that, or that he brought up the Smart Lock thing. And people could hack that, right? It's really, really easy to pick a lock or break into someone's house without being smart. You know, like, it doesn't matter. It's like super easy to do. Locks are just like a mechanism to make it just a little bit harder to just not open the door. The security pieces do sometimes scare me, I think in the sense that, you know, what, what if someone did hack your network, and or even they are in just another country, and they're now remoted into your house and can start controlling things that scares me, definitely is a fear of mine. But for the most part, like the security on that door lock is like that actual door lock is probably more secure than a normal door lock. Yeah, I don't know, that's been my thinking on it. But to your point on the software pieces, should people have certificates? I don't know. I mean, do we have it for Netflix, as engineers? And like, people rely on Netflix that, you know, we don't want it to go down? And, and so I think it's like, it depends on the products that you're buying to is like, how much rigor are those companies put in certificate or not? I think, how much do they care about their customers? I don't know how you measure that, or know that, maybe on reviews and things like that. But I think you do have to put in some effort to like do diligence to make sure that you're buying the right products. Now, is it going to be perfect? No, nothing's perfect. And to your point on the end of life, and I do not have a like rebuttal on that one. It is very upsetting when you've purchased an expensive device that you were now supposed to rely on for like four years, it should last you years, it's not just a year, and then they you know, the company decides that they don't want to support anymore. Google has done that to some of the NES products, they still support them. But they're no like, they're just, they don't sell new pieces for it.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I wonder is why we're friends, and I think we make good podcast posts is you and I think differently about probably the same problem. But together, we put our heads together and like, we come up with, I don't know, hopefully a middle ground that our friend and half our regulars appreciate. I'll call this out. And this is the smart home, this is just technology in general. Phones, somehow tech companies have pulled this amazing trick on us, where they convinced us to get these $1,000 phones, that TWO THREE YEARS LATER don't work anymore. And then that they convinced us to get another one. And it's like this incredible trick that everybody in the world is falling for. And nobody can do anything about because we just keep doing it. For instance, the pixel three, the Google Pixel three released in 2018. So that was, what, three, four years ago. Yeah, end of life in actually a couple days, no longer supported by Google, you can't call them for tech support, stuff like that. That was like a $700 phone. And it's no longer supported arbitrarily, because they there's no benefit to these companies that support old technology. The same with iPhones.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It's costly, right? Like, it's actually costing the company to support that.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
But as a consumer, it makes me not want to invest in anything because I'm like, I'm putting my money into something that a couple of years down the road or even a couple months down the road, may or may not be supported. So I just don't have confidence in any of these things. And I don't know, man, like we can build phones that are resilient, and phones that are last years and have regular patches. And that's like built into the cost of the phone. Like the company says, Hey, up front, we know, supporting this phone for next five years, 10 years is gonna cost us x. Let's bake this to the cost of the phone now. And we just move on with our lives. And it's all it's all good. But they don't. And we as consumers don't do anything about that. Again, I'm not anti technology that's that would be kind of wild. I work in the middle of Silicon Valley. I'm a big fan. I have seen the amazing magic that technology is I'm just like, we need to do better and we can do better. And this is this is kind of like my my plea to tech is like come on. Let's build things a little bit better. To me home home devices, IoT all that thing is like the bottom of the barrel. Because like literally anybody can make it. Like I can buy raspberry pi put a camera on it. Make a nice box you and I can market it, sell on Twitter, whatever. And like, we can do this, and no one's double checking, and there's no scrutiny or enforcement, if we're like, hey, six months later, there's version two, and we're not supporting this one anymore sex, be you, that is perfectly legal in today's world. And I mean, a lot to do about it. I'm not a fan of like big government or anything like that. But I don't know that we can just yeah, there's so much better than this. It's

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
interesting, like the phone piece of it. I don't know, it's, I struggled, like, I totally hear what you're saying. And I agree with that, too, is it's a kind of, it's just sad that you're like, bought this device, it it, it doesn't last long. I mean, it's still lost like that pixel three is still gonna work, you're just limited because certain things will come out. Or some of the like apps no longer work, or you can't, you can't update the iOS. And there's a lot of things like that just start to fizzle out. I mean, you might get an extra year or two out of it, but and then you start hitting more of those pain points. With the phone, I look at it as like, we've just become so dependent on them, that it almost feels like you've got such good use out of it even like $1,000 is a lot of money, right? It is like is $1,000 a year, a good investment? No like it, it should get a few years out of that. But it is something that we use on a regular daily basis that it makes me feel a little more comfortable that I'm like, Yeah, I mean, that's the cost that like, I need this phone, and I rely on it. I think that's maybe just what I've told myself or that yeah, like, I don't know.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
And I think that's okay. And and phones are an extreme example of like, this ubiquitous technology that we're all dependent on? And yes, is it a good use of our money? Absolutely. I use my phone for, you know, minutes hours every day, it's a very useful tool, I've been more pushing for either, let's invest in the technology to make it more resilient, and building that support over time, or be straight up with you and be like, Hey, you bought this phone. Now two years from now, it is not going to work. And that's just the way it is. And that's the expectation. And we'll take it we'll trade it in you do whatever. We establish that system. But this whole system of like, I think you you think you're investing in technology, but you're not you're just buying like a share of it in the moment?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Do we need subscription based like phones or something jam, like where I just pay like a monthly and every year I get a new phone? Or maybe more? Is it trading in the device? Yeah, maybe

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
maybe that's a more straightforward transaction between consumers and tech companies of like, hey, we will support this. But the good news is, you don't have to use it pass here, we're gonna make sure you always have the latest and greatest, that's cool. It's kind of like with cars, if you're like, you get a car to 100,000 miles, you're like, cool, I feel pretty good about that. I've gotten the value, I thought I'd get out my car because like, that's a long time you make the 200,000 year like, even better, I'm doing well. But like, you don't have a reasonable expectation that cars gonna make the 300,000 Miles like that, that's well pass everything on the car that was designed for. And that's okay. And I think we kind of need same for technology is like, either, like, let's let's build into assumptions about how long this thing is going to last and be straightforward with the consumers about it. And like, therein lies all my problem with smart homes and all these things. I yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I got I got a touch. I got to touch on this car. Yeah, it I mean, I totally get it. I like your you know, you know, when you're like 100,000 Miles is like a pretty good expectation. You're probably gonna get more than that. But you start having to, you know, change the timing belt, or there's things start going. But now, Jem, your comparison was, you know, what? 20 $30,000 item like a car? Sure. And compared to my $1,000 phone? So is there maybe a span like of life? Is that phone is actually I probably use it with my phone more than a vehicle to that's probably not the case for? No, I'm pretty sure that's the case for everyone. Everyone's on their phone more than they're driving. Maybe the phone is reaching its timeline, you know, relative to cost. Maybe that's what it's okay.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah. But like, companies know this, when they build things they know approximately how long it's going to last how long they support it for, like be honest with that is kind of what I'm pushing for. And that's from the big tech companies from the smaller companies. It's like, you need to have guaranteed support for X period of time for any device you purchase. And like we don't care if company goes under gets purchase, whatever you keep the server's up and running it is your statutory responsibility under the law. To do that. That's not asking that much that the thing I bought continues to work for like a prescribed period of time, but we don't and there is none of that. It's just like you roll the dice. You sure hope that thing you've spent all this time wiring up to your house and it's like why didn't everything continues to work time over time.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
But what if the device is like the last five years to have like, what's your beef with having automated stuff in your house like come on makes your life easier?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I don't know if easier is the right word. Maybe more convenient, but I'm willing to trade some convenience for other things like resiliency and security. I just shared a photo with you. And we'll we'll share this in the show notes. I don't know how we can face photos in the show notes. We'll figure it out. We'll place it on Twitter. Orion described for the our front end happier regulars what you're seeing in this photo.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Okay, so Jem has shared a photo, which I know that he has been recently shopping for a fridge and naturally jam is going directly to the smart fridges. Because that makes a lot of sense. No kidding. I'm sure he did not buy a smart fridge. But here's a photo of him in an aisle take taken a photo of this smart fridge that has a error message on the screen. That is like problems with the security certificate for this site. Not the best look when you're wanting to buy this expensive fridge. I don't know what the difference is actually because the smart fridge is kind of fits in that world of why like, I don't know why I need that. Like there are devices, I get really excited about some devices that I can automate. I don't know why my fridge or stove. Those things scare me. Why do you need to be smart and connected to the network? Cheers. Cheers. But I'm assuming gem this fridge is more expensive than the one next to it. That doesn't have the screen. Correct? A bit more awfully? Yeah. Okay, so it's not not a huge difference. But that doesn't bode well. This not a really good demo of it.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I was walking through Home Depot just you know, admiring prisons as one does. When When one becomes married and buys a house and as a family. It's just you end up at Home Depot or Lowe's or home improvement stores. Just you can't find it. You're just there all the time. Do you agree with me, Ryan?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Oh, yeah. I mean, I feel like that's, that's the cool place to go is Lowe's or Home Depot?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
It's a sign of a adulthood is you get excited, and you're like, oh, man, I can refinish my deck. That's gonna be awesome. Yeah, for those of you who are a bit younger, this is adulthood. Get ready. This is this one's exciting. So I walk into Home Depot, and I see this fridge with the tablets built into it. And I'm like, But why? Why? And then I look I look closely. And it's yeah, there's a certificate error on the tablet. And it's for the fav icon on on the from the browser. So it's not even like a real error. It's like, oh,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I didn't even go into the what the error was. Oh, now I see that that's even worse. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
And that that right there as part of my problem with technology is like there's so much that can go wrong, that I don't want that connected to me. I know about software resiliency. I know about tests and all these things. And I know that the more complicated code is, the more likely it is to break. That's just Yeah, I don't know, some some law of something called Ryan's law. So like, I don't need my frigerator breaking because they can't connect to Wi Fi or something like that. And like, Yeah, is that an extreme example? Sure. But like, that's where we're moving towards. We're moving towards Tesla's have features built into them, but you have to up you have to upgrade that through the app. It's like, Oh, you want the extra battery range? You got to pay for that. That's, to me, that's a very dangerous path, we're going down where, oh, crap, there's a software outage in my car won't work anymore. And like things that we're relying on, because they're connected to the cloud, and this infrastructure that obviously will never ever go down. And like, we don't think about the long term ramifications of this. So that's why I'm like, not everything needs to be connected, man. Like, some things, I just prefer to hold my hand and it works when it works. If it doesn't work, it's because it's broken. But not because some some engineer push the bad fix somewhere at some point. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think a lot of the devices and not all, they do have some sort of fallback. And they should, like I actually like a lot of the light switches, you can get Wi Fi connected light switches, they're a light switch, they work without being connected, but then they can also connect and so if there is an error or issue which I have actually had that where I've had to like reset it, but like it works on its own, it's you go up to the wall and you touch it networks. And so I think that that should be taken into consideration. And I think to your point, Jem, not all the devices have thought that through all make the joke to is it which you have not had to do this for me by the way. I love the Smart Lock because I don't have to carry keys around with me. And when I got this, it's been years since I've had it by the way. Javon first said that he's uh, yeah, soon enough in a month's time, you're going to be like calling me because you're locked out of your house and I've never had to do that. But it's same thing goes in at that point jam. I could also lose my keys and I'd be in the same boat.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Sure, but I have a physical backups of my keys. I think you have one of my house keys. So like that that's a solvable problem. But when technology is down, literally no one can solve it. Case in point, the Facebook property outage which essentially, essentially for a couple hours, not too long ago, Facebook was removed from the internet entirely, like WhatsApp, Instagram, everything was just gone. And like they couldn't get into their own server rooms because they're all built on their, their own technology. And that and that's what this is. It's like it's a, it's a cry for reason. It's like, Come on people, like the internet isn't just like this big machine that can't ever stop working. And being connected, can't ever stop working. The internet goes down the power goes out all these things in scenarios that often aren't planned for when they're building smart home devices. And that's not what I want, man, this is real life. This isn't. Oh, man, I can't get on Tinder. That's really frustrating. That's that's not going to hurt anybody. But, hey, my father's ventilator stops working because the Wi Fi won't connect. That's a real problem. And that that is where we're headed in tech is like, Yeah, more connected things when we really need to be like, does it need to be connected to the network? Does it need to be smart? Can it just work? And like is the cheers, cheers on network and is like, here's the connectedness additive. Is it really, like I think probably half the stuff in my house is Alexa or Google enabled. Why I don't need that. That's cool. But you've added more connectedness that, to me is just another point of failure for something. And we don't know what that failure will cause but we do know what cascading failures look like. And Facebook being gone is example of a good cascading failure. And it happens only one of the largest tech companies in the world. It can happen to literally anybody.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I survived. I didn't even notice that Facebook. Instagram was dead.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
But so yes or

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
no, I don't even use that that often. But I mean, Twitter is up where I was good. I'm happy. But yeah, I think it goes back to like, what you said about the Facebook one is pretty funny. Is that it? Yeah, they couldn't get into the rooms. And I think it's that type of area where you need to have fallbacks. Like you need to think through that. I mean, we have fallbacks for a lot of things that you just have contingency plans for that. And I think to your point, Jem, not all the companies are necessarily thinking in that way. They're like, Oh, it works. And when it works, it's good. But it's like, we can fall back to dumb, the door lock, the door can still open or the light switch. I think it's a perfect example. It's like, I could be down for months and like, it's okay, it's still still a button that works.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah, being being completely fair. Not completely fair. But being fair. This is a brave new world we're in like, since the advent of the Internet. And in computers, in human history, like we've just exploded in terms of capability and what we can do. So a lot of this is just purely untested. 100 years from now, I promise, we'll have more of this stuff figured out. Like, that's the nature of thing, the first people to build a bridge, it probably collapsed in the first first gusty day. And then they learned, Hey, we should build some more rigor, and then a few more bridges collapse, and they figured it out. And it took a lot of sacrifice to get to where we are. My plea here is like, let's not sacrifice all that, like, let's learn that everything we take for granted in modern society is because people have died. And people have we've learned the lessons of failure. Our houses are built with a certain standard, that means the floor won't cave in when you walk on it. And probably 100 or 50 years from now the floor will probably still hold up. Because like we've put that rigor in over time. And enough people have suffered consequences. And we are building codes, we have all these codes. Let's start applying that to engineering, software engineering as well. And I'm not saying certifications or anything like that. But like, let's let's just be cognitive. This is real life in the things we do affect people. So that time was this just a long winded way of telling trying to give me the right you're trying to get you to write more tests? Like so at the other day? Write your unit test Billy cheese, there's people depending on it? No, it's we we need more tests, we always need more tests. And that at the core of my argument is is my issue as far home as like, we know things are gonna go wrong. We know we don't know what we're doing. But like, let's admit that and not be brash. Like no, no, this will work. It's connected. It's got the latest Bluetooth specification 20 or something like that. You don't know. And like, assume for the worst and assume for the fail case. And like let's build against that. And let's build from the stable base of okay, we know that in the worst case, it will still work and everything will work. Our security is airtight. Let's build off of that. But let's not run and gun Wild West cowboy style the way we're doing it currently. I just I don't think that's sustainable. And it's only a matter of time before something really, really goes goes wrong. All right,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I got a question for you. Yeah, I don't disagree with a lot of the points but there's also some merit to some of these devices being very useful and and maybe even to your point it's like the trade off is like you're actually could be helping save lives or making things a little bit easier. You know, you and I both have kids having a baby, you're constantly checking on them to make sure like, there's things like SIDS, they can literally die while they're sleeping. There are connected devices to help with that, like the cameras now, like you can be, you know, have good. And there's been baby monitors in the past, like, I know, when my parents probably had some, like, old, I don't even know, probably not very good device that, you know, monitored sound. But now we can actually have these cameras that are are able to see over the crib and see what's going on. And then there's even devices that monitor heart rate, and you can you know, if something did happen, you're getting an alert. So I think there's, there's things that could actually help maybe it didn't go through the rigor either thought fails, especially the heart rate monitor that fails, like that's not great at all. But I'm just curious, like, what are your thoughts on that, like some of these devices could in fact, almost like some of the security risks some of the rigor, you kind of say, like, well, this is something I didn't have, like years ago, but this is really beneficial now,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
oh, man, Ryan, you just sent me up. I didn't even we didn't talk about this earlier. And he just sent me up so nicely. So I, we bought one of those devices we bought, and I'm gonna call this company out specifically. And you'll, you'll find out why we bought a Miku or mukou, EMI KU baby monitor camera, which monitors breathing, you know, it's typical nursery canvas, it's above the crib. But it does monitoring air breathing, temperature, humidity, all that other good stuff. But at the core, it's, it's a camera, we can check on him. And it was more for peace of mind. Because they will mark it as like, this is not a medical device or anything like that, you know, they try to cover their butts, as these companies do. And it was fun for a while. But for the past year, it like, doesn't connect at night, and it connects randomly. And what's frustrating about this is to me as software engineer, the problem is obvious. Because during the day, I can connect no problem. But at night, when everybody else is connected to their baby monitors in the cloud, and whatever, you can tell the server loads too high and people can't connect. And it's a very simple scaling problem. Like, I know this from my years of experience of like I can it works in the day, when no one's on it, it doesn't work at night, or in the mornings. I'm fine with that. Because I had, oh, actually, I'm not fine with it. But I am aware of the limitations of technology. And I accept that it's not going to work sometimes, because like stuff happens. But this is a essentially like a baby monitor breathing device that you want to check on your baby. And at two in the morning, you hear a cry or crash or something, you turn on your you open the app on your phone, and it doesn't connect, and you're just terrified as a parent, and every parent has gone through this at some point, probably multiple times in your life already. You're like, what is going on here, check out my kid. And that thing you counted on doesn't work. And this the Miku spark camera does not work it flat out just stopped connecting and worked in the beginning, it doesn't work anymore. And I'm just like, the audacity of this company's not fix this problem. And this isn't me, you go on the Android app store. It has a one, a one star review for like 1000s of people. So like this a long standing problem. But they continue to sell this device with impunity. And like, again, there's no oversight, there's no enforcement saying like, this thing needs to work the way it's supposed to. It's like, oh, consumers will regulate themselves. But and it worked for a while. But like, this is something people are counting on. And yes, it's not a life saving device. But it's a baby monitor man, like, when you when you need it, you need it, it needs to work. And this thing doesn't work. And they put no effort into fixing it. And that that is one example of a real life thing that you know, I tried to spark device and it just doesn't work. It's a camera at the end of the day and the camera doesn't load. So these are solvable problems. There's just no will to fix them. And companies don't don't care because there's no benefit to them. They already sold me the device. There's no money to be made in fixing these problems.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Did you not read the reviews on a champ?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
No, because when I bought it about a year and a half ago, it was working just fine. It was good reviews. Yeah, and just the past year so it just has crapped out completely. I read the reviews now.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
No, no, I'm just curious when you'd said that because I'm like yeah, I think that that kind of goes into the like you have to do a little bit more of your own research on that and I usually you do so I was curious. I was like oh well that's odd. I've never tried the heart rate monitor one at all, but I know that that's a thing I think that wasn't something that I had or maybe just didn't even know about it when my son was born but I thought I could see that being useful but I also saw it as being like oh if it starts to like fail a bit and starts going off like wakes me up at two in the morning and like I think my kids not breathing like that would freak me out so much the camera thing if it doesn't work it's It's just frustrating but it's not gonna like send panic. Yeah, it's frustrating. I've definitely had the can cameras, not that one and to have had never had an issue where it's not working throughout the night and everything. But you're right, there's points of failure, that you now become dependent on it. And I think that that's maybe to your point that I'm arguing it, I guess is that like, we now we come dependent on these devices. And if they're not working well, then that's a problem. I mean, I'm dependent on the internet, we all are, like a lot of us are. And it's very, very frustrating when the internet does not work. And that still happens. I care more about that sometimes in my water work, like seriously, like, it's like, I need the internet running, you know, for work, especially during COVID. It's like, yeah, you're on on video calls and working all day long. It's a utility, it needs to be there at all times. So you do become more dependent on these things. And I think they're to your point, maybe 100 years from now, or Vivi hopefully even less that it's like we are dependent on it, but it's a lot more reliable.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah. And that's, that's the like that tricky Interplay we have is, these, like you said, these devices are so convenient. A lot of them do save people's lives. And there's no question that technology is a benefit to our lives. It's just we've gotten sloppy with it, we we assume things about it, like we assume, I don't know, with this breathing monitor for my son, I assume they've written tests, and they put a lot of money into security. So so I can't hack in and, like whisper terrible things, my son will be sleeping. And like all these things, like we assume that like, isn't there, like tech companies, you can have a shiny website and a great product, or a great looking product and all these things. And you look down that facade. It's you know, 50 interns running around, and then one product manager who's like yelling at people, but like, we don't see all that. But from our side in Silicon Valley, and in the middle of tech, we have some insight in the behind the scenes. And we know that stuff just isn't built that well, like a lot of it's just show. And there is no security or anything like that. So yeah, that's that was my rant on smart home and all that hope, you know, I'm not anti technology, it's just, we can do better. And I think we need to do better as an industry.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Do you still buy smart home devices Damn.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Rarely, there, there is technology. I like the Nanoleaf series, we're not fixed. But I've been told like that my pick is the Nanoleaf. Fantastic pick that piece of technology, it connects every time I've never had a single problem with it. Don't get me on Twitter, like mine doesn't work. models work just fine. They clearly put a lot of thought into the the interaction, they make it fast and stuff like that. There's lots of technology that I think is solid, because like it's only built to do one thing. And it's not trying to be smart. It's not trying to slurp your data or like be more connected than it needs to be just like do one thing. I think smart lightbulbs, like you said, are a great example of that. Like, it only needs to do one thing. I don't need a speaker. I don't need a microphone. I don't need a camera built in. I just need a light bulb that works. And a lot of those do that. And it's great. But it's yeah, it's just overreach and over promising when like, people know, they can't deliver on these things. But they do it anyways, without thinking of this is real life. And there are people on the other end who are suffering the consequences of just sloppy engineering.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I like that too. Maybe that's an a piece where it's like, yes, some of the devices are they trying to do too many things all at once. Like because even to the point with the baby monitor camera, which of singing about it, too, is like baby products, like I wouldn't want to do a technology around babies. Like I feel like that's like, if we're going to put any rigor on things like that is absolutely like, you know, me getting locked out of my house is like, not a concern at all. Compared to like a small infant that like that. That's a whole nother thing. But yeah, maybe these devices like the baby monitor, it has like temperature it has, you know, microphone, it has whatever, like heart rate all these different things and they're trying to do so many things at once and is that do one thing and just stick to that rewrite like the Nano lights. You can control it from your phone and connect it to a network. Cheers.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Cheers

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
kind of had to throw that one in. I felt like it'd been a while. But yeah, so it is smart. But it's it's not trying to be like overly smart at that point. Yeah, like the alright, I feel like we definitely covered some things I don't know if you've convinced me not to do smart things. But I mean yeah, I definitely share some opinions where I I'm not buying a lot of the products I'll tell you that much like I definitely have to read reviews or I try some things and get really upset with them or frustrated and they were no longer connected at all because I just I don't have the time of day for it. But I have found some that were I find them to be very useful. They work great. They haven't really been a pain point where they're failing and so that's been great. Like I I get excited when those things like I get them all set up like jam you get excited going to Home Depot, Lowe's, like there's times where I'm like, I get really excited like setting up a cool new device and it, you know, I can get something automated and it feels it's a toy for the house and I enjoy that. But if it starts to bring pain, where it's like you're come reliant on it and it's not working on with you, that's frustrating. So I mean, I think we left off in a pretty good spot. I mean, just Gemin my like thoughts on this. I'm sure everyone else has their own opinions. You know what actually hit us up on Twitter on the front end, happy hour at <a href="https://twitter.com/frontendhh">@frontendhh</a>. Tell us like, what your thoughts are on smart home and tell us the devices that you like or dislike, I would love to see that I'm sure you would jump to let's hop right into pics want to hear all your smart home device pics for us, Jem, go ahead for

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
pixel a little light. I could go through my list of Broken Dreams and disappointing home technology. But I won't. I won't call on my auntie Silicon Valley pick with Miku smart breeding monitor slash nursery cam that does not work. And I do not recommend it with my strongest do not recommend this your child Don't Don't mess around with companies that don't care about you. I'll pick a show. I have of course gonna pick the what is now the most popular television show right now in the world. Which is of course Ryan, what is it? It's gotta be squid squid damn on. It was good. The I felt the end episodes kind of dragged on a bit longer than they needed to. Like, we kind of knew where it was going. But they stretched it. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. But on the whole, I love the concept. And this is what I love about Netflix. And I'm not just saying that because I work there. And we will do I like that Netflix bring stories from other cultures. Because I think it's one thing to preach like diversity and inclusion. And like you should always get another viewpoint and like you should respect other cultures that are different from yours. And I think that's easy to say. But in practice, it's really difficult to look at someone who does things very differently and be like, I don't understand you all are weird that that's you all do you I'm never gonna make an effort to understand. But when we can tell stories, and share the stories of other people that that is so powerful. And that's what I really like about working working at Netflix is like, we have the chance to communicate through stories in a way that like, hey, they're not trying to preach to you about anything. But would you have anything about what would you know anything about what it's like being debt ridden in South Korea? No, why would you? But you've got what's your story? And like, yeah, the story has a larger point. But that was insight I never would have known about. And now I do and I I have a bit more empathy for people in other countries who are struggling with debt and poverty and all these other things. And that that's really, to me what's good game is like globally around the world, we now have leveled up our kind of cultural IQ, just a little bit more than we did before. And before Netflix before the internet, like that was not possible. We never went to even

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
just Hollywood movies that we really see it's it's not, I'm sure you could try really hard to go get those niche films and TV shows that are out there. But yeah, I really appreciated that and even seen how popular something like squid game is in the US is amazing to see. It's like here's this Korean story that's been filmed and made in Korea, and then brought to the US and people love it. Like that's so cool. And I'm not just the US it's it's worldwide is a lot of people are watching it and really enjoying it. I think that's that's so powerful. And so cool. That was my biggest takeaway, like I enjoyed the story and everything too. But that felt really cool to see.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah, I'm excited for what we have next I know. And later half this year, or later part of this year in 2020. We have some big shows coming out. But I'm just so excited to hear about these stories and from around the world. And like understand that it doesn't matter what language you speak or where you grew up, or your socio economic background or education. We all have these common human burdens that we all share and like that is what makes us human and like we should stop arguing over these petty things like politics and ethnicity and understand we all bear the same burdens and that that's that's the power of a good story. And like honestly, that's one of the reason why we're in Netflix. Anyways, that was not a Netflix promo, it just, that's just the way these conversations shape sometimes. Awesome. That that is my only fit.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Awesome. I have two picks. One is, oddly enough, a smart home device. And it's actually just such a small little device but it's probably kind of maybe even fits into the worry. It's a smaller company. So you know, take it with a grain of salt. But there is a company that it's called Starling. They made a small little device that connects to your network chairs, it basically extend some of the Google nest products to other like some of the Apple ecosystem that you just couldn't do before, because Google and Apple haven't always played nice on that side of the fence of some of the smart devices. And so it just, it tightens that up a little bit. And I really like that. That's actually one of my pet peeves we haven't we didn't even really cover in a smart home devices is like, everything has its own app. And like I want things more tied into one centralized place. And where you can have something automate off of another thing, if there's a motion that the the lights turn on, or whatever it is, like, you can do certain things like that. And, and that's sometimes what's really bothered me it's felt limiting on that. And so this device does a little bit better to try and connect some of those pieces. So I thought that was kind of cool. I just recently tried it out. And I've been impressed. It was really easy to set up. Seems to be working good. Now. Maybe I should hit me up in a month or two if it's still working. I hope it is. I so far has been really good. I do like it. That's my first pick. And then my second pick is a TV show. Not on Netflix. Well, my awesome binging of squid game, I needed something a little bit lighter. It's a deep story. I don't know what else to put it. But as my cleanse show, I've been watching a show called only murders in the building on Hulu has Steve Martin Martin Short, Selena Gomez. They're like these three strangers that live in a building in New York, and then they end up getting together to solve a murder that was happened in the building. And it's kind of cool because it they end up creating a podcast around it. And it's it's definitely like poking fun at all the like true crime podcasts out there. Even some of the like the music and it even reminds me of podcasts cereal, like it definitely has even some of that like background music that they use. And so it's like plain throat. It's a little bit like a dark comedy and they're trying to solve a murder. I've written really enjoying it. So definitely worth checking out maybe to get a little less deep than on murders. It's not as deep as something like squid game, which is awesome show. All right, well, thank you all for listening to Jemen my special rants on smart home, there's a lot of fun just hearing gems perspective. And I think there's there's definitely some overlap. I think that we kind of met in the middle in some places and then on the other ends of the fence, which is perfectly all right. Thank you all for listening. You can find us on Twitter at front end age. You can listen to us on wherever you listen to podcasts on and you can go to front end happy hour.com Any last words Jem?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Ryan, would you use a subscription based fire extinguisher?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
No. But then again, I guess like, do they come in like fill up my fire extinguisher? Check it out and everything. Make sure that it's okay.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
me. Maybe that's okay. Right there. They're out there taking care of it. Jem, what about a Wi Fi enabled? chainsaw?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Oh, yes. I mean, what could possibly go wrong with that? Just leave nothing there. My son's wandering around and won't actually turn on or anything like that. I'm sure.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, no, I mean, and, and why would you ever, ever need that to be smart?
