Welcome to our year and episode of the front end happier podcast. I mean, we've survived 2020. It hasn't been the easiest year for anyone. But I'm super thankful that we've decided to continue recording new episodes, we figured out how to record remotely, and we've kept publishing episodes, so I'm really happy for that. But I'm also super thankful to this panel. Seriously, you've all kept me sane. I honestly don't think I could do it without continually recording, even though that we aren't in person. It's it's been amazing that way. So yeah. In today's episode, we will be talking about the past year, and how things have changed for our work and lives through 2020. Let's give introductions of today's panelists. Jam, you want to start it off


<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Jem Young Senior Software Engineer at Netflix.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Hi, I'm Mark Julian. I'm a senior software engineer in the Bay Area and all thoughts are always my own. Either 2020s This year, I'm going to give 2020 My thoughts because

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Stacy, Stacy London is senior front end engineer on Trello. Still at Atlassian. I just thought I'll just be more specific.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Nice.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Surely I am surely Whoo. I am an independent creator of data visualizations.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It's a nice title. I like I guess this

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Gustus here in software engineer at Twitch. And I'm Ryan Burgess.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix. In each episode of the front end, Happy Hour podcast, we like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all, in the episode, we will all take a drink. And what did we decide today's keyword is 2020 or 2021. We are done with 2020. Let's move on 2021. From now on, if we say that word we will all take a drink. All right, well, let's hop right into the episode. What has changed in your workflow? Since we've had to pivot to being remote

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
everything? I don't know where to begin. And I don't know if anyone else has a better answer. But one thing that I've been really, really missing this year, and I feel like is sort of the biggest loss for me is casual interactions in the office, it's really hard to replicate those conversations you have over lunch or getting coffee that you know are either really restorative or just can lead to like aha moments and projects that you're working on you like make connections between things that are going on at the company that you wouldn't have made otherwise. And everything in this virtual world is like more formal and scheduled. Like you have to schedule a zoom or you have to reach out proactively on Slack. There's no sort of like happenstance anymore, and I really, really miss that same

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Mars, have you or anyone figured out kind of the water cooler talk? Like have you figured out an alternative been virtually I mean, I've seen teams like

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
schedule water cooler time, as but I also just like going into that you're like, I have a day full of meetings, I have to go to this 20 minute like meeting full of probably 10 people that you just kind of stare awkwardly in. I don't know if I would love to hear if anyone else has come up with a solution to this. But we have not at least

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, similar to you, my team has a weekly coffee, that it's it is totally at your choice if you want to show up or not. Same thing, we have a weekly lunch. So there's two of these meetings that you know people come and go, but it's not the same. But I still to be honest, I look forward to it. Like it is something that's made me feel a little bit more normal. And we're not talking necessarily about work really. It's just casual talk and building that trust and learning about each other and just even talking about how painful 2020 has been no like the classes

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
we've come I think, or I worked as I started a coffee club for front Enders, which is sort of just like pairing random front enters together to like for a half hour to just get to know each other sort of like what's going on on different teams like into the mixture, like what you're saying, right? Like work and sort of more casual like social stuff, you know, what's your newest quarantine hobby? And that has been sort of the most random happenstance. If that's a word conversations I've

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
had Yeah, I feel like the same. I feel like I've missing that. I feel like there's people that I haven't talked to in like six months that I probably talked to occasionally at work because we would just run into each other. But like, because we don't really work on the same stuff. Or we don't have like, I don't know, I just I'm missing that. There's something there. That's like that's gone now. And yeah, it's like how do you recreate that? I don't, I don't know. Like, I just joined Trello and one of the things that they do which is kind of cool is like guess like, they'll have like a town hall meeting that right after it. And I don't know if this is something that's built into zoom, or if it's an extra piece of technology, but they like it. Whoever sticks around, it breaks everybody into little side rooms. And it's just like a casual, like, get to know people maybe that you don't know on that on on Trello. And like, just like casual chat kind of thing. I thought that was really cool. So that's, that's something that I mean, again, yeah, it's still like, scheduled. And like on your calendar.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It's like, we're still trying to replicate that like casual conversation. I've been at conferences, okay, let's go back conferences in general, I always love going to conferences in person, half of it is not, I mean, there's amazing talks, always. But the majority of the reason I like to go is the networking aspect. And so you go to a virtual conference, and it's like, where did that networking go? I have started to see some of them do like the randomizing which is really cool. And so you can like just be like, randomize or like, I want to be networking, and it will just like start pairing you up with people that I think is kind of cool. I've also seen at Netflix, there's a group that I'm part of where I think this actually happened before quarantine. But anyways, it still works now more than ever. But in Slack, it starts to just assign you people to meet with for coffee. And I thought that was kind of cool to where it's like, oh, just like it's taking care of that. It's still a scheduled thing, though. That's kind of part of the problem.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
It's not like it's not serendipitous, I was gonna say, as a conference speaker, it's been the weirdest year because part of the reason why I love speaking, or no, okay, hold on, I should say that there's 90%, I am extremely anxious about speaking and the like, then the 10% that makes me keep going back is because I love looking out at the audience. And I love seeing like people's reactions. And I love seeing when people are nodding along and enjoying the ones that aren't. And I love like, being able to like have like, I love when people come up afterwards and are like, Oh, that is exactly the problem that I've had and like, or like they're like sharing their experiences with me or giving me feedback about what I talked about. It's been the weirdest thing to be like pre recording talks. And then I'm not seeing anybody's reactions not getting that much like feedback afterwards. And yeah, I think that's a part I just can't get used to the like kind of lack of direct human connection. But I will say that I'll probably be the wildcard in this episode, because like, I'm just like chaos and all of this conversation about going remote because I went remote four years ago, when I started freelancing. And so actually, from a work perspective, everything, like there wasn't that much of a change in that, like, everything has been already streamlined for me to work remotely with my clients. But I think the reason why I joined a studio, like a like a studio office two years ago was because I miss exactly what you've mentioned, which is that kind of like, casual office chat that I always also felt like was the best part about being in an office. And then I was able to find that with my studio mates. And there's like five of us, it was again, very weird to suddenly lose that social aspect. And then what I didn't realize was the amount that I loved being able to change my setting of being able to go to like a cafe if I needed to, like switch up my work or like you know, that like kind of routine of going to the office and coming back and then coming back like I'm more casual mode. And then without those, I feel like more than ever, I'm just working around the clock, because I don't have like a good context shift between like, work and home. And I think that's something that a few years ago, I experienced when I first went freelance, I just worked around the clock, and I realized that I was doing it at the beginning of this pandemic. Also,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I totally resonate with that. Because when COVID first started, and we had to start working from home, I personally could not work at home. Like I've always gotten used to it now. But I totally do that thing where I contextually associate a home is where I just sleep and play games and just have fun. And work is where I go work. Like when I was in school, I would go to the library to study because dorm is to play games and and go to stuff like that. So that was like the big the biggest struggle for me. It took me a few good few months before I got used to it.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I'm with you, too on that surely on the conference aspect, like I've tried doing the virtual conferences, and I still will do them because like, I love conferences, but it's just missing some of that human aspect. Like you don't see the audience and like you do play off the audience like it, you know, even if you if something doesn't land, you know it doesn't land You can either follow up with another point or just move on. But you're sitting in front of a screen and have no idea. The other day, I think it was last week I did an hour and a half AMA, which I don't know if it's supposed to be an hour and a half. But it'd been an hour and a half with me sitting there reading just a chat of people ask me questions. It was a lot of fun. But I was just talking to myself, basically, because it was like, I didn't have that personal human contact. It felt really weird. I mean, we we try and supplement these things, but it's still I don't think there's a solution for it.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
All right. Surely everything you said like resonates with me, right? I mean, I did one, two online conferences this year. I'm not I'm not doing any more virtual conferences. It's just not satisfying. Which is weird to say. But yeah, as speakers we do get satisfaction out of delivering good talk and seeing the reaction. Without that. I it's just not what I'm good at talking about a camera. I like what you said, Surely I feed off the vibe. And it's just, yeah, it was like so soulless and unfun. And like I'm telling, I'm saying jokes. But I'm like, I hope this lands. I don't know. I like surely you said serendipity, which I would say it's the most accurate word. There's that just like randomness of bumping into someone and you're both in the right mood at the right time. Because like, there's plenty of times I'm like, Cantat Hey, Jem, how you doing? Hey, Jack, cool. Gotta go. Like, you know, it is not there. And the problem with scheduling virtual Hangouts is you don't know where the other person's going to be. Versus like, if I saw Ryan Ryan saw saw me and I'm like, heads down on something. He'd be like, Hey, I know that one on one. That's another day. So I saw you're busy, like cool. First things now I have to like pull out my director out of like something some big critical decisions that have like a one on one and like reset fives and all that stuff. When you don't you pick up a lot from body language, and you just miss all of that over promote Hangouts,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
body language, that's a big one for me, like I do struggle with that one, you can hear tone, you can sometimes see someone rolled her eyes or like, you know, there's there's some reaction to certain things, but it's a lot harder. I think there's certain things that you can pick up on in a like an a meeting room, even if it's a large group of people, you can start to pick up on those things, which is, is very valuable. Like you can start to read the room and say, like, wow, we're not heading in the right direction. Like I got to pivot and maybe suggest something different. And not just for conference talks. I mean, literally a meeting or like a suggestion for a technical approach, or whatever you're talking about. That human aspect of it does make it a little bit harder, because you're not seeing the person in in person.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I've heard something as simple as the fact that with video calls, you literally cannot look a person in the eye. And that's also like something, something that like makes it really discomforting of like, that's something I don't think any of us consciously notice. But like, it's something that makes it feel like even less of a connection, because like, you just cannot stare a person in the eye to have the conversation.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I've never even thought about that. But yeah, that's fascinating. And

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
you're like, oh, yeah, totally, yeah, Netflix, we use Google meat. And I'll pull my browser and it to its own tab for the meeting, and raise it up to as high as to the cameras possible to try and make sure that I'm looking at the camera instead of looking down at the right corner or wherever it is. But it's still no matter what you do. It's never perfect on II. It's just it's not going to happen.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah, oh, my camera way down. So people can simulate what it's like to actually

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
you know, it's really funny is there's people that have started at Netflix that have started during this pandemic, and they've literally brought up how tall are these people? Cuz you don't know they've literally had those types of conversations where they're like, how tall are you? Because they haven't met in person. I think one thing I've had to do is get better about scheduling time for myself, like blocking time off. My normal job is a lot of meetings as a manager, but I just can't do that many zoom meetings over and over and over again, it gets very draining. It's so much worse than being in person. Probably same thing to surely jam like the we're all talking about. You play off of people. I feel like in person you do that, but on video, it's just so much harder. And so I feel like by the end of the day, I'm super drained. So I've tried, I don't know if I'm good at it, but I've tried to like schedule time where I'm going outside or stepping away and just lock in that time I had regular lunch blocks which I try and stick to so to kind of build up that routine a bit to it has helped. I don't know if anyone else has felt like that doing something to make more of a routine or just or even like stepping away like Augustus you said that it's like I used to play like play games at home and enjoy my time. One thing I've done is literally, here's my workstation and I walk away from that I do not touch it. I'm sure there's times that I've touched it. But anyways, I try really hard to say like this the end of my day, I'm not going back to it. I don't know anyone else find like routines helping Oh, yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
yeah, for sure. Like one routine I still haven't gotten myself into and I'm hoping to in 2021 Cheers

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
as Bisset on this one

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
is how I used to commute by walking or bicycling. And so it's a good way to get some exercise and I have I don't go anywhere anymore. So like, I have not replaced that I'd like us to like go out in the mornings and take the dogs for a walk. But that's certainly not the same. Same thing, like it's not the same distance. And I haven't forced myself to just like, almost try and replicate that like go for like a really long walk. That's about the same as it used to be. So I should get that back. So I think like I've heard of people doing that, where they like, go for a walk around the block or whatever. So it helps them think that they're going to work.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I personally have struggled losing the commute, like there's positives not having to commute. But I had an hour shuttle ride to work and then an hour ride home. And I was very productive in those times. But it was mainly it just kind of like started my day on the shuttle ended the day. And so that was very routine. And I lost that. And so I still have not got that time back where it's like downtime, like nobody's talking to you for a solid hour. I mean, they might ping you on Slack and things like that. But I could like respond to emails and things, I still have not been able to replicate that

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
same mine was driving to work and driving home just like listen to music, maybe the occasional podcast, but that was like wind up wind down a clear delineation of work at home. And now like the guest has when you mentioned, it's the same chair, I relax to play video games in that I do work that I talked to my friends and family. It's just weird. It's like not the natural state for humans, I would say. So if you're feeling anxiety, that is totally normal. Like, this isn't how we're meant to operate.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
However your company's dealt with it, like Have they adapted well, or has things changed, I'm assuming they have a bit. But anything that's changed for the companies, I don't know,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
not specific to my company or the industry that we're in. But one thing that's been really interesting, at least in the workforce is how it's kind of brought the in office employees together with the remote employees. Like before, there was sort of a difference between, you know, a remote workers, and those who were in the office. And I think that it'll actually result in some positive changes in the future to think about, like, we've created empathy with them now and sort of think about how we can integrate them a little bit more into the company and the the community and the culture going forward. Which I think will be really, really, really interesting.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Yeah, I agree. Like as a like freelancer, independent, like, just perpetually remote person, I'm actually really excited about the, like, what this means for the industry, like, at large to, like, for example, I guess it's not, I don't have to keep it a secret, like the one place I interviewed in these, like four years was at Netflix. And, and one of the big this is such a, this is such a trivial sounding con, but one of the biggest con for me was that I could not remote. And because I hate commutes and, and I will have had like a 45 minute commute. And I have a those are things that I mean, we could probably also do a whole episode about deal breakers for a potential job. That was a really big one for me. And I'm actually just like, really excited about, um, companies being more willing to have remote workers and being accommodating about them.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, and you know, to speak to Netflix part that has been a barrier in the past where it's like, Netflix has always been like, oh, yeah, you're you're on site. I mean, people would work from home, but it was more like there was never people would be like, on the east coast, right? Like, there there was like you were in the office or in the facility. And and that's even changed, like we've gotten more flexible on that just because of the pandemic you start to learn and adapt and I think that is really cool. I think that is something to be said is like, all of us as a whole like the world had to learn and adapt and it at really could be more flexible for us in the future, which is really exciting.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So I think real question to ask everybody is what is the future of work specifically tech work, because people will say and pundits Alright, oh, it's obviously remote and everybody's remote, blah, blah, blah, but Like we just spent 20 minutes describing why remote is not ideal in many, many circumstances. So what is the future?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Well, I mean, for me, I think surely mentioned something, too, is changing up your scenery, we don't have that option right now. And I think that's a big thing, I worked some remote for a good year and a half for a company, where we would have been a flight to actually get to the company. And I didn't do a good job of my home office was where I worked. I never went to coffee shops, and this is going to date me, but at the time, you didn't have good Wi Fi it like coffee shops, and like, there wasn't we were acts and things like that. So you didn't really have that option. And I look back on that and reflect on it. It's like, yeah, I would totally if I was working remote, have a shared workspace, or can I at least go there once in a while, like have some place to go once in a while. And I think that that's like a lot of what we're all talking about is the human contact is like you still need that. It just may not be like every single day that you need it. It's just the flexibility. And so maybe you are on the other side of the world working for a company. But I think right now in the pandemic, you can't just go to a coffee shop, you can't go to a friend's place to work together and just hang out. I mean, you can, but you probably shouldn't should.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I actually really agree with that. Um, but I think I would also add on to that, that, um, I think providing remote work as an option, like not mandating that every day be spent at the office, I think even now, I think we're pretty lucky in Silicon Valley that a lot of companies are, like tolerant of like, one work from home day, per week or something. But I think there's a lot of companies still there aren't tolerant of that. And I think, I think that this year has shown that like, you know, one day or like, a few days a week or something where it's work from home, it's actually really nice, because you get to get I personally got a lot of work done when I got to work from home. And I think it's really that like having that as an option. Not necessarily like a requirement, because I do think, you know, speaking off of like what Maurice and Stacy and everybody here has said that, like, I think that like kind of serendipitous chance encounters and conversations really help you understand a company better, like what's going on in a company better. I know, my husband says a lot that like, that's kind of how he understands, like those chance conversations or how he kind of Grox how like his company is doing and like, where his places are, like what upper management is thinking. And so I think that shouldn't ever be replaced of like, I think there should always be an option to go into the office and like bump into people. And also, I think there's something to be said about like, I also read something that someone said or posted online about how his experience about, you know, how he moved from London to New York, and how he made most of his friends and his social circle was actually through his work because he spent so much time with them. And he would be so sad if he never had that experience because he was a remote worker. And so I think, I don't think it's like a must be one way or another. But I think it would be really nice. If there's an option for both. I think there's like, there's definitely introverts like me, that will love a more hostile like remote option. But I think there's also a lot of extroverts that would really miss kind of that office atmosphere. And I guess the only thing is that, like, if there is going to be that option, then probably the office should be downsized. So that like you know, the collision still happens even with like less people.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Yeah, I really, I really liked the flexibility aspect. And I think that the idea is that we will be fully remote now that we've experienced this, like, again, ignores all of the social aspects and benefits to being in the office. I wonder too, in addition to flexibility, if also it'll lead to like a more diverse workforce, because we can, we can hire from different areas in the country from different backgrounds, you know, different resources, like not everyone can take time off of work to come interview across the country or you know, wherever their company is, and might also choose to, like stay where they are for personal reasons. And I think it's gonna be really interesting to see how that plays out. I think it'll be tough, but we've kind of we're kind of beginning to adjust and we're more cognizant of these different ways of working now and I think it'll be it'll be really positive going forward.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's such a great part point. Mars. I'm so glad you said that because I think that is a big benefit. It's like you can broaden your workforce but you also allow flexibility for people to to be with their families to you know, take say like I have my son I don't know, dance recital or whatever, who knows that you're like, I want to go to that that's out like five o'clock or 430. And if you had to commute for that, that you would just wouldn't make that. And so like now you actually have the ability to be a lot more flexible on that. I think that's huge. I mean, God is literally going to be a huge selling point, and allow us to really build diverse talent pools.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I also think like, so surely you kind of talked about this, but how we the tech in tech, we're pretty fortunate to have a work from home once a week. And it's it's so interesting, because I feel like there's this stigmatism where if you're not working together in the same area, you are not as productive. And I definitely I definitely started off kind of because I have issues with associating my workspace but But over time, I definitely I would argue that I am way more productive. Now. There's just like less of that. You know, somebody coming in interrupting your time and, you know, you have to get stuff done. But now you feel inclined. I don't know. Maybe I sound like a terrible person right there. But,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
you know,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
people know what I need, you know, you're working on this thing. Like, oh, I really should get this done. And you're like, hey, does this you want to know? How's it going? Like, Oh, pretty good. And he's just like, really? Do

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
you not see my headphones? It's like, yeah, you take off the headphones,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
like, oh,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
passive aggressively taking up the headphones.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
feature a feature request for zoom, they can like build this feature where you can like, pop into someone's screen without even asking them. Hey, did you get my email?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I sent you a Slack message I emailed you.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Have you? Have you all heard those horror stories of people whose companies made them like leave their webcams on all day under the guise of like, we just want it to feel like the office. And yeah, I've heard of stories. Like I don't have any specific company. So I just feel like made up internet stuff. But it sounds like a real thing that like managers or middle managers would do in the name of like productivity or something. I have heard

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
of people doing that, where they'll leave screens on even before we are in the pandemic where it would be like someone was remote, and that they'd have this like screen that was like visual to the rest of the team. So that it could be like feeling like you were there. I mean, I don't think it was from the oh, I'm checking to make sure that you're working or checking that you're productive. It was more to make them feel like they were there and like part of the team. But like I personally wouldn't want that. It just feels weird. I don't know. I don't

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
want you see what YouTube and Netflix like watching. Like they're perfectly innocuous. I don't want you like, knowing how much I watch.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, the nice thing is they don't see you the screen, right? Necessarily. It could be like a fixture of you. Like they might not see your screen. Okay.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
That's a good idea. I get too comfortable at home. So let's just leave it at that.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And that's fair. I mean, I haven't worn a pair of jeans in like, since March. So

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
yeah, you'd like drop in and see me wearing the same outfit for like a week.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I just have the same outfit in like, you know, seven times.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Yeah, I just have the shirt like seven, seven times.

<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
We paid it on 2020 A little bit has there been some positives, like there's gotta be some silver lining,

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I actually brainstormed a bit. And I was like thinking back on this year. And so I actually wrote down some things of the big bad thing. The main bad thing that happened for me personally in terms of work, and then kind of the some of the good things that came out of it. So if you don't mind a little bit of like a soliloquy of personal reflection, the actually the big bad for me wasn't actually about like going remote. And the big bad for me was that I didn't have a client for four months, because the clients I was very excitedly talking about back in March, they all dropped off for financial reasons. And then, um, and then I couldn't book anybody or I shouldn't say that. I think there were still thankfully, requests coming in. They just weren't what I was extremely excited about. And so I was I was also lucky enough to have like personal savings where I could title her for the four months and so I guess this is more for I guess any I knew that most listeners have like a full time job. So I guess this is the kind of like the independence perspective, if anyone is curious about that, but I really They thought about, I think in that time that I didn't have like a client for four months, it was it was really hard mentally and emotionally. But I think there were like some really good things that came out of it for me. And the first thing is that I had a lot of time, because I didn't have a job to pursue personal projects that were at a much bigger scale than I could have previously, when I did have to balance that with client projects. And I think what that meant for me personally was that, like, I was able to do personal projects where I assembled a team to work on a project and, and then later on, I assembled at later on, not only did I try and assemble a team, I also went out and tried to secure funding for my own personal projects. And that's something that like, I've been really scared to do and intimidated to do. And I didn't do them at any big level. But I think it just like gave me more courage. And then I think, having that time, also, like, gave me time to try, like hobbies that I've always been, quote, unquote, too busy to do. And I think that like really helped me open up like possibilities of like, where I could go forward, kind of in my, I guess the things I want to do in my career. And I and that leads to kind of the last thing, which is that this lack of clients for months actually gave me the space to really kind of introspect and reflect on having kind of, like, stripped away everything, it gave me kind of the space to think about what it is that I really actually want out of my career going forward. And one of the things is that, actually, I think allowed me to come to terms with the fact that like, I actually am no longer really that excited about what I'm currently doing. Like, I think there's still projects that are really exciting. But like, I don't have the passion for what I'm currently doing, like I used to. And so I think it like really allowed me to kind of be okay with admitting that like, oh, like I actually what I've always loved is learning new things. And this big thing, I've spent years like cultivating this big skill of like data visualization on the web that I've been like spending years culminating, that's just another thing that I've had a lot of fun learning, and that I actually just really enjoy the process of learning things and the struggle and then kind of like, that feeling of success when I am in excitement, and when I like kind of pull it off. And so it's okay, if I want to like move away from that. And kind of like take the pieces I really enjoyed and then like, move forward and incorporate that into the new things I want to try. So is the good things that personally for me, for work came out of this year.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Nice. See, there is some silver lining

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
21. I'll add, well, I don't think this is for every for every team. But at least for our team, our team was pretty fortunate that we were still pretty new. And then the pandemic hit, and I feel no onboarding processes, I'd actually be very curious to hear, you know, Stacy, moving to Trello what that experience was like, but onboarding processes sometimes can be kind of a nightmare sometimes, but because everybody's remote, I feel our team really took it seriously that hey, you know, for us and starting out, you know, we really need to like up our documentation. And, and, you know, we used to have these habits of say, Oh, they can just ask us and we were very, very personable. But it really makes us think about what that experience is like when nobody's around, you know, if you're very, very, not, if no one's there, how like, what does that document what should that documentation look like? How do you help someone with that? And that's kind of leveled up, I've kind of noticed, I noticed that for every team, but I was just like something that I noticed that was kind of a side effect that happened, which I really appreciate. And another thing is, when people are living at home, you learn about things that you might not learn typically, like, for example, I didn't know one of my teammates had a dog. And it's like, oh, I have to take my dog. Like it's like a conversation points like oh, you have a dog. No, you like, oh, no, yes to be in it.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
So there's

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
these like kind of subtle, happy moments, I guess.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I personally love like when kids run into the dog. It's It's so good. I really actually truly enjoy that. And to echo your point to Augustus a little bit maybe even broader than just onboarding. I think communication has gotten better. It's not easy in this world. But I feel like there's more flexibility in the communication. Like, I feel like people are like writing a memo. They're recording meetings, they're trying to set up like multiple meetings, if they have to share the same context with people, I feel like people are getting more more flexible, like you're getting more information in different ways. And I think like, that's something I actually want to see play out in 2021. If we were in the office, cheers,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
years, I don't know how to phrase this, it's like this year has been this year where you've seen maybe some of your teammates, or even yourself, you've exhibited, you know, high levels of anxiety or a lot of emotion, at work in ways that maybe you haven't ever, you know, before. And so I think it's built a lot of like, maybe more empathy than ever between teammates and understanding that people are coming from different circumstances and being at people checking in on each other more, it just seems like it's brought out something more human in all of us, which shouldn't take that sort of shouldn't take what happened for that to to be the case. But I think that's been sort of a bright spot out of this as, like, I've seen people just care a lot about each other

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
in return, like I love the empathy part. But it builds better trust to like you start just open up and build trust with your team members. I think that is that is definitely happening more than it would have if we were all just going into an office together.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, cuz you're going through something at the same time, you know, like this sort of

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
shared experience. It's yeah, maybe shitty, but we are all experiencing it together. Yeah. Empathize on that. I mean, even something simple is for me is like, as much as like I mentioned earlier that I missed my commute, but I don't miss my commute. Like, I actually am, like, really thankful to not have to deal with that. I've done a commute for like five years where it's been like an hour there and an hour home. It's, it's a lot. And so there's been times where I'm like, wow, I can just like end my day, and go spend more time with my son or my, the rest of my family. And like, that's, that's pretty cool. So there is some benefits on that side. Or even when there was points where I was having to do more childcare, like because it was like, you couldn't have a nanny, you couldn't have schools open. And so like, I was literally taking like part of my day, just like spending more time with my son tonight. That's time that you can't get back. And that's it was pretty cool to be able to do that and balance my work and do that at the same time. So those are some of my silver linings for sure. Keep

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
saying, well, 2021 or 2020 years, yes.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Hey, take it back. Take

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
it 2020 I had a son and I went a over a million dollars in debt. So sorry. So So for people not in the Bay Area, that means I bought a house No. So the silver lining is getting to watch my son grow up, which is like such an incredible privilege that we have or that my wife and I have to see him go from like this tiny thing that can move to something now that attempts to climb out of the crib, doing his best, but like just just seeing that is like so there's no other scenario this that could have played out short of like us being unemployed, that I could have seen this and witness like, humans, this is how humans are made. It's like just amazing experience. So yeah, for me, it's been pretty good. And I can like get off work and I just go pick him up and there's no commute to annoy me. There's no like, oh, Dad's gonna be like stuck in traffic. Like there's not that I'm just there.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Alright, so what I'm gonna say the keyword here but what are you all excited for? For 2021?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Cheer everyone's being vaccinated.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yay. Yay, here,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
maybe getting

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I just I miss hobbies. I don't know I have not found a quarantine hobby and all my hobbies kind of shut down on the pandemic shutdown and it just I need a way to engage my brain that's not software engineering or reorganizing the furniture in my house. Something else? So I don't know. I think like a diversity of experience. The ability to like variety of settings and people you interact with in a day is just like, it's just does wonders for your mental health. So I'm ready for it not to be Groundhog Day, I guess is what I'm trying.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I love that. What month is it? I have no idea like just If blurs day, that's yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
like it was there.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I like that I'm honestly hopeful and excited to just be recording in the same room. I'm so excited for that. I do not like recording remote. So I'm pumped to see you all in person.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Cheers to that.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Cheers The managers. I'm very excited, because I'm excited by my curiosity about what will happen post pandemic, and what we'll take away because I feel I truly feel a lot of companies will embrace remote work. And who knows, maybe they'll be okay with saying, you know, what, if you want to just remote, you just want to continue working from home that's chill with us and seeing how that plays out. You know, because especially in the Bay Area, traffic is a huge problem. I hate the traffic I Hate. Hate those things. And and maybe it'll go down, you know, maybe a lot of people will realize I'll just work from home. Everyone's cool with it. And who knows, maybe there will be a really good balance of traffic and the ramifications of that. Right. So I'm very curious,

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
oh my gosh, maybe people will move out of Silicon Valley and like rent prices or like house prices will go down.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Oh, fascinating, right? A miracle. But this pandemic, so unfortunate, of course. But you know,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
maybe we got to look at some optimism. Yes, for sure. That's right.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I was gonna say just being able to sit in a cafe and work from a cafe again. But I'm also I've been watching a lot of concert documentaries. And maybe this is like a subconscious part of me that just like raves like humans jammed into a big stadium again. And now I'm like, I used to be so cheap about concerts being like, I don't have any money for for concerts. And now I'm like, I will shell out for like the artists that I'm excited about.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
So that's I missed music and going to shows and dancing in fits so much, so much. So maybe that'll come back in 2021 I miss

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
getting tattoos.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I miss getting haircuts and getting my eyebrows shaped because that's the one thing I don't trust myself to do my eyebrows.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Yeah, I miss all my favorite service providers and like waitresses at all like the small business city. The people who make San Francisco San Fran Yeah, correct them anymore. I'm really looking forward to going out and patronizing. I mean that you don't like being a customer at this. Yeah. So those that survived, so

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
love it. All right, well, maybe to help some of those people Mars, we can jump right into pics, or there's some great pics that you have to share. In each episode, the front end happier podcast, we like to choose things that we'd like to share with you all that we find interesting or would like to share with you all what pics do we have Stacy want to start with it? Sure.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Speaking of music, and as always, for my picks, I have three today. So the first one is a song called her revolution. It's by burial for Tet. And Thom Yorke, which is an amazing group. They it's been like a decade since they last collaborated. So let's get like burials sort of crackly production, time your, you know his falsetto voice. And then you get four tenths ambient since it's it's a cool, it's a cool song that but there's two songs on that release. And they're both really good. And then the second song is called Darden chorus by John Hopkins. It's actually a cover of Time, York's Dark Horse from 29 teens album anima. And it's just his like piano take like on that one chord sequence and he kind of explores it in that song. And it's just a really like hopeful song. And I just, I feel like it's the soundtrack to the potential of the vaccine.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I love it. 2021

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
years.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
The third and final one is to end the 2020. I I've checked out the shownotes for shares. It's the 2020 mix. So all the songs that I've really enjoyed throughout this year, right

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
on Mars would have okay,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I guess in the spirit of small businesses, which is the semi rant I went off on, I'm going to pick one in the city that I really like they're called Derma plus SF. They're a skincare facials. Yeah, they do facials, but they also have a resident nurse. But what's really interesting is that they also have their own line of products like custom hand blended products that are really good for you. And so you can order stuff on their website. And also, if you follow their Instagram, they're always doing really cool just like skin health tips and stuff. So that's the first one. And then the second one, which I really enjoy, but it's kind of bordering on like a valley silicon pic. So jumping right in smart pet feeder that's microchip that opened by microchip, but they just came out with a new one called the feeder connect, that also connects to your phone. So super smart. And it comes with a little hub that looks like a kitten with like, ears that light up. And it tells you how much your animal has eaten. If you want to know that information. And also like x is like a scale so you can zero it and do like portion control and stuff. So if you're really into like, all of that stuff for your pet, I highly recommend this,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
though, right? Like it's because like You're like did my pet eat today or not? Like that's that's good to know. Yeah, that makes sense.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
That to me, I'm excited about like, if I go away on a trip, yeah. To know that my animals are eating while I'm gone.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I love this post pandemic. You're like, Yeah, I'm not going anywhere now.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I'm really am not that.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Awesome. Surely Where do you have?

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
So I have to today, um, ooh. But also I keep I don't know what it is about today. I don't know if it's my choice of drink. But I keep coming back to topics we've already like visited I maybe it's like just my one track mine. But the thing I'm excited about 2021 Is I'm potentially having my wedding, which may or may not happen, it might have to be 2022. But you're supposed to be this year, fingers crossed. Anyways, two things for today is the first is I've like I'm now newly obsessed with this concert documentary. It's called Black Pink light up the sky. And it's a documentary on Netflix on a this Kpop girl group called Black Pink. And I was really into KPop back in like the mid 2000s. And then I like phased out of them, I think in the 2010s because that's when like all these big KPop bands came in that had like 13 members. And I was like that's too big. And then I haven't really been following that much Kpop but then this came up on my Netflix and it was Netflix is very persistent. And so I finally watched it, and I'm so obsessed. So like pink is a four member girl group from Korea. And they have like a pretty unique sound of like, I think they're a good balance between like hip hop, rap and pop. And they were at Coachella last year. And they were like one of the like, standout like big acts of Coachella. And or sorry, they weren't a big act. But they were like a surprise. Like everybody was like, wow, they're amazing because they have like such powerful dance moves. And they have like vocals. And I think the fun thing about them is like, all of this I learned from the documentary is three out of Oh, also they're only four members about as opposed to 13. So you can actually remember all of their names is that they three out of four of them actually grew up outside of Korea. So they're quite International. And then like that blending of cultures is really nice. So after watching this documentary three times, because the first two times I put on in the background as I was doing other things, and they're speaking Korean, so I missed a lot of the dialogue. So the third time I actually watched it, I'm now obsessed with Black Pink, and I love their songs. And it's been on repeat on Spotify. So please check them out. Because they're they're like, really fun. Kpop. So that's the first pick. And then the second one is I was thinking about some of the things that like got me through 2020 and one of the things is found in studio may Alice Lee started a stream with Adobe called Doodle therapy. And on each kind of episode she's in the recent episodes, she's like, kind of brought on guests and Alice herself is like an incredible illustrator and muralist. And she's also independent, and like me, and so I really enjoy the conversations that she has with her guests, where they talk very candidly about kind of like a wide range of different topics while doodling they're all like illustrating in Photoshop at the same time, and like also managing the chat at the same time and they're like talking candidly about like life and like you know, their work and like their creative inspirations and, and especially like if you're a like, you know, a front end engineer that like also that was in design or interesting illustration are interested in like freelancing. I've really enjoyed her show. So highly recommend doodle therapy. It's, you can find it on Adobe live. She usually has it Mondays and Tuesdays, and her exact schedule is on her website that should be linked in the show notes.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Right on, I got this what do

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
you have? Actually so funny because I feel like Charlie and I have very similar like, in the sense that, you know, same sources. Okay. Well, I'll just get into my first pick is a Netflix show. Wow. Called Alison borderland. Yes, Netflix was very persistent. But it was it's so good. It's actually based, I didn't realize was based on a manga about this guy who gets sucked in, there's this game, this game master and all these kind of sick twisted games. And I was I didn't want to give the show a chance, because I don't like saw or those types of shows or movies. But it is not like that. The games are very intelligent. Yeah, there's some like, killing and stuff like that. But I find the storytelling is very well done. The character developments really good. cinematography is like really, really, really great. So highly recommend. And my second pick is something related to Adobe. It's on their react spectrum blog. So spectrum is the design system that Adobe has, and reacts. Oh, yes, Mars, sorry. React react spectrum is the React implementation of that design system. And they have a blog, where they have a three part series. It's written by Devin COVID, COVID. I hope I'm saying that correctly. He's the creator of parcel js. And it's called Building a button. And I've

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
been on he's been on episode or Yes, yes, yes.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Oh, yeah. I believe so. Yeah. The series is called Building a button. And you know, you think, wow, building a button. That's such a simple component. Right. And he, he really, really goes deep dive into all the complexities of how do you build a button component that you know, really handles all the cases? You know, there's a lot of things you might not think about, like, for accessibility for screen readers. Focus, focus rings, focus. So definitely, highly recommend. We're going to link the part one, but there's a three part series, so highly recommend checking that out.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Nice, Jem, what do you have?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Ah, see, I only have two picks this time around. That is interesting. First one is a pic. shared by all my friends. Yeah, which one? But doesn't matter. I'll take them later. I Vasa did a piece on the world of professional tag, which is like, it's really cool. Because so what it is, it's people who did parkour, which, like Parkour is a sport, but it's like, how do you? How do you qualify as score? How do you? How do you measure it other than subjectively being like, Oh, that was cool. That was in high school. So essentially, like the people we beat, they liked to play tag. These are two grown men, like click tag. They're like, Wait, why don't we just like build out their courses. And it turns out, like, people that are going to parkour are really good at the sport because it's like obstacles and like chasing people around and and you're evading and you're doing all the things that you do in parkour, but you're doing it like in a sports arena on the team. It's like working watching, I really hope this catches on because it's just incredible. The way you move. And they're so fast. It's insane. My second pick is Valley silicon pick. That is where I highlight things that are too expensive and absurd, and they only exist because we get paid. Just way too much money. The question is, how much would you pay for a beanbag chair? $30.30 way did I hear 4034 20 and

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
30. So far? 20 to

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
30 120.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
depends on the quality sighs Yeah, other

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
good quality beanbag chair. So,

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Miller.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
There's a company called Lovesac. And they create beanbag chairs and this beanbag chair, which will hold two adults it looks like starts at $1,300. For beam, just this one. I think it's one thing for like a couch or a bed or even even a table can have like good design, good architecture, but it's pretty hard for a beanbag chair because it's it's materials stuck with something and that's kind of all there is to it. So anyways, as far as furniture goes, I know people can be like, Oh, that's a $20,000 laptop. It's beautiful it I don't know, it moves me, it makes me feel emotional. I don't know, that's our but you know, it's a beanbag chair. It starts with $1,300.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
When you get by, it's probably the 20 or $30. One and probably just be as nice.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I have to say that one of my friends had it. And I've jumped into it. I don't think I was as sold. But my husband who's like, super frugal Asian, was like, I love this as I watched it, and I was like, I do not understand. But there must be some sort of an appeal. It was very comfortable. It like kind of like molded to your shape. But I don't think it's like $1,300 comfortable.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
It was very big.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
It was like a good foothold many people.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I imagine they're they're quite comfortable. It's just yeah, you mean 30? Cheaper?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
$1,300. Right, coach, I'm like, Yes.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Maybe this is a couch a turner. Maybe it's an alternative.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Is it though?

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Is it what it says that the big one

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
can fit two adults and two kids and it's only 50? This apparently the super sack, which I feel like can we talk about these names is one adult and two kids so I don't know where the other adult went?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Into the other sack.
I'm gonna move on. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right. I just have two picks, hoping people can maybe binge these by this point. But there's two TV shows I started watching on Hulu one, which honestly, I'm not a fan of Hulu because I have to like they're literally being released weekly. I want to binge these but first show that I'm picking is called a teacher. And it's about a story about a student that slept with his teacher. And there's this whole scandal around that. So far, it's been good, but like I can't watch all the episodes. I can't tell you how great it is until they've released all the episodes. Second pick is another Hulu show called Big Sky. Still another one that's seems really cool. It's only a few episodes in about some girls that go missing and some murders that happen. Very cool story. I think it's it's going to be really good. It's like I think it's only like five episodes in. I'm continuing to watch it so I'm enjoying it. So I'm hoping to keep watching it. So those are my two picks. Thank you all for listening to today's episode and continuing to listen to us through the 2020 pandemic. We appreciate everyone listening to us and still enjoying the episodes that we're putting out. So thank you all. You can find us at front end happy hour.com You can follow us on Twitter at front end ah any last words
