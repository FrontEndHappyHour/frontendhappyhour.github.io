  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Welcome to the latest episode of the front end happy hour podcast. This is actually a very unique special podcast where we are recording remote. Typically all of our episodes are recorded in one room around a table having drinks. With the recent Coronavirus situation. We're a little bit stuck and not able to all meet in the same room. So instead of not recording we are all going to continue recording even if it has to be remote because we want to make sure that we're putting out content for everyone else stuck in their homes. Given we're all being forced to work from home along with a lot of our listeners due to Coronavirus. We felt It was topical to have this episode about our experiences working from home. And there has been one major benefit. I would say that we're now recording remote. Maybe it's a benefit is that we're able to have a special guest joining us from Seattle, Brian Holt. I mean, it depends on how you define benefit. Well, that's why I said I'm like, I don't know some people might find it a benefit. Some people will see some people might stop listening right now.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  We'll see how many cheers we have. It might get really entertaining. Might be a fun time. I mean,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  we're all bored at
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  the ration or alcohol then.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, I got plenty. I stopped. I'm out of toilet paper, but I
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  got plenty of alcohol. Nobody needs toilet paper stock up on the booze. All right. Well, let's also give introduction of today's panelists. Jim, you want to start it off?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  Jem Young senior software engineer at Netflix,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I guess this year and software engineer at twitch?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Mars Julian I'm a senior front end engineer in the Bay Area and all thoughts are my own.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I'm Stacy London. I'm a senior front end engineer at Atlassian. And all my thoughts are Mars's.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Alright, I'm Brian, a glum I'm a senior software engineer at Netflix. I'm Brian Holt sometimes with me on this podcast and I'm a Senior Program Manager at Microsoft and all my thoughts are steve steve bombers.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix. In each episode of the podcast, we love to choose our keyword that if it's mentioned at all in the episode, we will all take a drink. And what did we decide today's keyword is? quarantine, quarantine, quarantine quarantine very soon for this episode. All right if we all say the word quarantine which Brian's already told us that we will be a lot we will all take a drink buckle up. Yeah. All right. Well, let's let's dive right in. How are you all feeling about the Coronavirus situation and working from home.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  I could start people don't get sick me talking. I'm a little Yeah, like this has been legitimately harder than I thought it was. Like, well, I'm okay No One No One needs to like call anyone or maybe I don't know if you tell me you'll find out at the end of this podcast but it's it's been difficult not having like face to face contact and not going out very much and it's really like disrupted my routine, like going to the gym and going to the coffee shop and going to the bar which I'm I fancy myself a bit of introvert. I mean, what this I'm on like day 10 of Microsoft's mandated work from home. And yeah, if I mean they can see my peloton here in the background, if I didn't have that I would be literally like running around my house just screaming. clothed or not. I'm not really sure. Yeah, it's been tough. Hey, at least you're getting some exercise to one way or another.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Yeah, I'll say the same thing. In our remote work episode, I talked about how I'm the type that needs to have people around. If I had to work from home, I would like go to a coffee shop. And now that's not even an option. So, so it started off pretty bad. I think I wasn't very productive. But I think as time has gone on, I've gotten way more productive. I've gotten used to it. So I actually really liked it. Like, I don't like COVID-19, of course, but I gotten used to the remote work situation. So do you think that will change after 30 days? That's a good question. 
  We'll see. Yes, we'll check back I
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  have two kids with me, my wife and my mother lives with me. So I've got plenty of people to talk to. But the interesting thing for me is, you know, whenever I leave my house, I'm always super worried that I'm gonna bring something back to my mom because she's definitely in the high risk group. So I feel like I should be super shut in. But if I when I leave to go for a run, like Could I come back and I'm, I'm worried I'm nervous that I touch something or did something that could endanger You know, my mom's health, which is kind of an interesting way to care. I
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  just bathed in bleach. That's what I do.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Don't drink. Don't drink the bleach.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Don't drink it so you can bathe in it. That's totally fine. Just kidding. No one bathe in bleach. I'm about to get served a lawsuit. This is a terrible idea. I'm signing off the podcast.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  I don't know. I don't know why we have to tell people not to drink bleach is one of the things that should be self evident, but don't drink bleach. It will cure everything including your life. Well,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  one way to kill the virus
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, I would say that. I mean, I've been set up to work from home just from over the years working from home occasionally. So like I don't unfortunate that way like I have a desk and like monitors and all the things that make it feel comfortable. But I think to like kind of what Ryan was just saying the anxiety of all this is actually a lot and it is hard to concentrate. I'm normally I'm quite good at that at home actually. Cuz I feel like I have less distraction. And I don't you know, have coworkers coming by every five seconds. So you know, are no visual distractions, that kind of thing, but just everything the weight of everything you know that like the stock market's crashing, you know, you're losing retirement money and you know, very privileged and fortunate enough to even have savings like that, but you know, anxiety of that plus the anxiety of this, this virus and like thinking about my family and my parents, and, you know, they're definitely in an academy an age category that's, they're at high risk. I also have, you know, friends that are immunocompromised or friends that aren't in tech that could possibly lose their jobs. They can't work from home. So like, add all these things up. It's just like a swirl in your brain. And it's definitely hard to concentrate on work in that kind of mindset. So definitely a struggle trying to, you know, refocus and be like Alright, so right now Code write some code.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, I think like echoing that it's a lot of the anxiety and like beat just being anxious of all the things that you both just said. Then also just the unknown. Like, how long is this lasting? Does this continue? Are things getting better? Is this the new norm? How long as that for I think that also just starts to make me feel very anxious. It's definitely made working a lot harder because you are thinking about those things. But then I also have to remember to is that Yeah, maybe we just aren't working at full capacity and maybe being okay with that, which is actually very hard to say because you like Oh, you want to perform and you want to be doing great. That can be just add to the anxiety. I've also found like Ryan mentioned having kids at home, I've actually found it very difficult to have be working from home dealing with a toddler running around and not having someone to look after him. So both my wife and I are working, trying to juggle who's looking after him who's on him. Meaning, you know, when's the best time to work? We still haven't figured it out. So we'll see
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  how that goes. I was gonna ask like, how do you feel productive? For me personally, it's been really hard to feel because again, I think a lot of my productivity was based around routine, right? Like, getting on the bus getting there like, listening to my podcasts, reading my emails, and then getting there and having like, my meetings and going from room to room like it was very, like mechanical in nature of how I felt productive. And now I roll out of bed like an hour later. Hopefully my bosses and listen to this podcast.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I mean, you don't have the commute though. Brian. You don't have to commute walking over.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  That's true. My commute is, you know, pants optional down the stairs. Maybe hop on the peloton. Maybe not and then just start working from there. But yeah, so that's been a real struggle for me is like getting that feeling of productivity back so I have no idea if I'm less productive or more productive. Honestly. Maybe at nine percent the same productivity rate. But I feel like I'm 20% productive just like the feeling inside of me, which causes a lot of probably undue anxiety.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  I think for me, my my coating has been through the roof. I've roped into more pull requests, I think in the last two weeks, and I have in the last two months combined. But the other work that I do that involves talking to people and collaborating and coordinating things is just I have no fucking clue what I'm doing there becomes a lot harder to have those conversations like I mean, look at us. We're on a remote call that we usually sit around a table. It has its challenges. It's not as easy.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I think it's been interesting to though just like it has been I will echo like, what everyone's saying. It's been difficult. It's been anxiety inducing, like trying to find a schedule that works when you literally are rolling from one room to another like Ryan said pants optional. Like, it's hard. But on the plus side I don't know about you all but like it's been really interesting to see like the team kind of come together at least my work team Come together over slack and just being more kind of empathetic and like emotionally connected to the colleagues and creating a sort of all these like informal ways of connecting virtually that we haven't ever done before. And the situation is not great. But as a silver lining, there has been quite a lot of like active bonding, which has been really interesting. And I'd be curious to see how that plays out in person. Because we all are all kind of going through like a shared experience and even more so when it's when it's your team.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Actually, even just today, my team and I had a virtual lunch. It sounds weird, like just thinking about it from an idea standpoint, but in practice of just being able to connect even if it is virtually, and just talk about, I mean, we talked about Coronavirus a bit but just even like, What are you watching on Netflix like what's like what other things are you doing other than work to pass the time just like you're quarantined?
  
  Yeah. Brian, how do we cheers So, Stacey, I know you'd mentioned the like workstation that you have already had a pretty good setup. You have the dual monitors, you have a desk and everything set up. But I'm curious like how has everyone's workstation been working at home, I will just speak for my my immediate team like I'm good, but like a lot of people who don't really like working from home or haven't and don't even have any setup at all, some people rent a room in an apartment in San Francisco and don't even have a full apartment to themselves. So their room is where they can kind of do stuff but that means working on your bed, and that's not very good for all sorts of reasons posture. Then there's also no gap in your work and home. I've seen some of the people on my team working in hallways like stalking books, as a desk and like also that's another thing is even if you do want equipment, it's really hard to get either yeah have to go to a store which now are inside Francisco Bay area there's stores aren't really that open for something that's not essential. And then ordering stuff is a lot slower to so it can be really difficult. You all can see right now I'm working on my dining room table,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  right? Like, I don't have an office because I once I became a program manager, I have to be in the office every single day. And so I I bought the essentials like I had a mechanical keyboard, thank god cuz that that just feels nice. I see Stacy smiling. She knows
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  she knows what it's essential.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  It is. And then I bought like a like a little stand like one of those like rain aluminum stands for my laptop, so at least it like sits up so I can like have like a high level and like, you know, I don't have like my camera like pointing up my nostrils and like, terrible lighting. So like, I can actually feel like I can turn on my camera. So like just doing things like that, like trying to make it as comfortable as possible. But like it's hard for me because I don't wanna spend any damn money on this because like, I don't know how long it's going to last. Probably I'm not going to get to work from home very much again when I get back to work. So I don't know That's, that's been a struggle for me as well. I think
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  that's an interesting point, plus one on the dining table. That's where I've been working from too, because I don't really have a setup. But I hope after this, if anything more companies will be open to remote work. And people who are investing time to build a setup at home, it'll be worthwhile. So I'm really hoping that this, it's kind of interesting, because this whole situation, I feel is some sort of social experiment in some ways, like, because a lot of people have talked about how remote work might be the future of working. I mean, some software engineers we're pretty fortunate that where we can do our work wherever and you know, traffic is like insane in Silicon Valley, and many other places. So I don't know I'm hoping
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  I'm pretty hopeful I gave on my Windows machine. So I was already set up. Part of this like I I haven't chimed in much because I've been on paternity leave. For eight weeks now, so I've been watching this play out really slowly for me it's been really slow. I'm like, Well yeah, of course it's gonna happen. And like, I see random spikes of panic and I'm like, you guys didn't see this three weeks ago like, and I forget everybody else has their like other lives going on my life is
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  a baby. Mazel Tov, by the way, thank you corrente Thank you.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Cheers,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  but my setup is the same as my gaming setup. I got kicked out of my office. So now I'm downstairs next to the kitchen. But you know, I've got a nice IKEA desk shouty IKEA they're pretty cheap and they're huge adjustable legs, IKEA for everything. Like Don't, don't spend money on like a desk, the desk of the desk, I got my office chair. It's one of the Steelcase ones, but I got to use. So there's entire sites that just sell refurbished chairs and they're perfectly usable. They're they're kind of expensive still. It's like 300 for used one, but it's amazing, like get a good office chair. I've got my widescreen curved 30 four inch monitor which is great for gaming like for coding it's awesome with an HDMI connector so a pretty well set up I also have mechanical keyboard I just got two audio engine speakers I got rid of my old Logitech I got some like good speakers so I am ready I'll say this like look at the curve I was well set up for gaming so we'll set up for coding being ahead of the curve I'll tell you well now is front end happier listeners by a good webcam because you'll stand out and beating so rather than like the crappy like Mac webcams like get ahead of the curve now get a good Logitech or like a third party camera. Feels like wow, who is that person that really stands out meaning they have a better camera. Look at that beard. I've got that beard it's so shiny getting Yeti.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, my mic the mic audio is good. I've definitely been using my Yeti on calls same
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  you can tell and you can tell the difference when you're on a video call Tony's like the full equipment versus Sony's like still winging it. I'll say this and my research and nada, not research. Just having observed this over two months, it's gonna last a lot longer than we think. So I think that's some good equipment. Now, Brian, I like your point of like, when I get back to work, I don't wanna waste my money, but I think we have a few months of this. So
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  yeah, that's just like general floating anxiety in my brain.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, I do like what you said, GMO investing in some equipment, I think, whether it be maybe if you're very vain and want your beautiful beard to show on on a camera, maybe that's important, maybe not, but I will echo the investing in a good chair. The first day, my wife will both her and I are working from home I have invested in a chair in the past, and she has not. And it was like in a lot of pain just from sitting in the one chair that she chose to sit in all day long. It's not meant to be a desk chair that you sit on long term. And so even that first day, she was like, Oh, I'm in pain. And so she's, she's done a lot better job now of just like switching spots and locations just so she is moving a bit more. But yeah, having a good chair goes a long way.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  I did the same thing jump that I found Steelcase leap chair used. And it's been such a lifesaver. I can sit at home and work all day and not get sore. Because my wife picked this lovely white thing. Oh, she can't sit that thing for more than
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  it's very aesthetically pleasing. Yeah, it's
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  a good looking chair looks good. Yeah, I don't want to sit in it.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  desk chairs aren't the best looking. I gotta say that like office chairs. They're kind of ugly. Even though like the most expensive desk chair. You're like, this is not that good. Like it doesn't look that good.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, I got a I have an error on
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  that. All those are good.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah. I probably gotten a Steelcase after Jim told me about it cuz it sounds like a cloud for your ass
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  as a service,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  but yeah, this. That's like the one redeeming grace of my working areas that I do have a nice chair to sit on. Otherwise I'd be sitting on my desk. That'll appear from
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  yesterday on the Pelton chair will not go along.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  So I've heard all of you like, since you're all actually working, and I am working on keeping Baby Alive. It's a lot of work. Let me
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  echo that. That is like the hardest job
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  I like. Like, dismisses like, I'm pretty smart. I'm pretty good. My wife's very smart. She's really good. How hard can it be? It is a full time job. Take care of a baby like you wouldn't think because they sleep most of the day, theoretically. Like, you wouldn't think it's that much work. Our big concern like the separate a bit aside, but like our concern is like, we have to go back to work. But like we're literally doing the same thing we're doing before. So like our routine is like way, way way. It's gonna be very difficult to go back because it's just doing the same thing we're doing before just with work now. And a baby like nothing has changed on that front. We're really counting on getting a nanny or daycare or something, but we'll figure it out just like everybody else around the world is figuring out but so can I ask you all since you've been working for from home for a while. I've heard it's better to Like, get out of bed, take a shower, go to your dedicated work area rather than no fence, rolling out of bed in your boxers and going to work because I've heard that doesn't work very well, it just makes you less productive. But,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  ya know, I'll be the first one to admit that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Yeah, so actually, I find that really interesting because, like I used to, I still work from home occasionally, but I didn't have a good routine around it. Because it was like the exception, not the rule. And so everyone was kind of like work from home days were just like, normally less productive. But having this like, continue to work from home was like really forced me to think about like timeboxing it and like taking taking breaks. So it's been really interesting. So like, I mean, a lot of the literature out there and in my own routine is like, go to work, quote, unquote, and then find it find a thing that triggers you leaving work. So even though like I don't have no need to shower, really we can smell it from here.
  
  Yeah, you can smell me. I'm gonna shower. I shower first thing and then I get my coffee because we're not in shelter in place in LA yet. Get my coffee go to work and then the end of my day I just am like Okay, I'm gonna go for a run and I'm turning off my laptop and that's the end of it. So that routine has really helped me even though I've never had it before just because work from home is sort of like oh it's a fun thing to do because I don't have to do it every day.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, I definitely have found there's been a couple days where I just like was like all shower later and I put it off and it just kind of bugs me like I'm like oh, I you know and so when I wake up even been waking up early like it's not like I'm like have to be up that early. Wake up a shower, just kind of like my regular routine. And coffee is definitely important. Surprisingly enough. Not all coffee shops are close to they are still serving. You just can't sit in them like the coffee shop by goto actually removed all the chairs. So you you can just walk in, get your coffee and leave. So you can't still go out and do those things which to me is I've even been doing the odd time to just feel like good reason to get out. Another one that I found staying productive is keeping the workspace clean like that, to me has like around me it feels I feel like I'm not distracted being like all this mess is bugging me. Those of you who know me will be kind of shocked to find out that I took it to a weird, crazy level and I've actually tried to even eat the exact same breakfast I do at work. So I went out and bought Special K and blueberries. All the same snacks I have at work.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  Yeah, I'm trying to keep the same routine down to a tee tonight in your family
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  to go mess with your monitor. That would just make me very happy.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  I should bring my kids in here and you can ask them what happens if they touch daddy's monitor.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I just want to plus one the kind of morning ritual like trying to keep it consistent. Like I got a pour over somewhere too. What twitch has so I could just make my own pour over coffee. That's kind of like a nice morning ritual. You can just grind your coffee, make it and then get started. So,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  so wait so so far the front end happier work from home list is what do we say? Yeti microphone or at least a good microphone, a good chair, a coffeemaker, coffee machine of some sort? set everything.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Does anyone have any, like non equipment related things that are part of their routine? Because so I'll admit I like a really good candle when I'm working and that may sound a little a little weird.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  But it's very la have you
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  know, this was in San Francisco. All my candles are at home still, unfortunately. Cool.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, I believe you. I mean, I like that. I also think like sometimes even just like a good music of choice, whether it whether you're coding or even just something in the background. It could be white noise or just something to feel like you're not 100% alone can be helpful, but I love the candle idea. I don't have any good candles, I'm sure they're kicking around. Summer in my house I should try this
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I have a pic for it later very millennial Candle Company with great descriptions perfect
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  okay that's even better I'm excited for even more so
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  one of my favorite things is Addy comes in and brings me animal everyday that keep me company.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  That's amazing.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  This is door Rhino with a bow that she is brought me today, does it? I'm never alone in here. I don't know what it's probably riney because that's how she names everything she
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  is a an algo follows would you say it's quarantine to your desk?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Cheers Sherry, thank you for a couple people Ryan saying that he's open way more pull requests got since you've started to feel more productive. What are some other advantages that you've all found working from home? No commute?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, that's a good one.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  One that I really like is I have a better exercise routine. Just without I guess it ties to the no commute. There's no commute. I have more time to do the things that I like to do, which for me it's involves exercise.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, I think It's interesting. I've seen all these people, like, on social media talking about, like, what are you doing with all this new time? And I'm like, thinking to myself, because I mean, just like the hour you get back from commuting or do you, like what do you do at night that like, now you have all this time to do. Like, I find it interesting. So I'm like, mostly kind of a homebody. Like we don't go out that much. Like sometimes I go to concerts to see music, but like, most evenings, I'm like, cook some dinner and then do that act like read or whatever. But like, That hasn't changed much with all of this, but everyone's like, Oh, I don't know what to do with all this extra time. And then like the audio mean,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  or like just watching everybody's reaction on Twitter, which is Twitter's just blown up insanely in two weeks, just everybody's on now are just even just talking to people as they do in passing on slack obviously, but it's just like introverts are like, you know, not much has changed for me, you know, I can't go to the gym anymore. So that sucks. And then other people are like, this is terrible. This is the worst. And it's interesting to see the personality splits just there are people that count on the like 5pm after bar drinks. There are people that are like well, I just go home and hang out my significant other my pets or whatever. I think
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  that's actually like really important to highlight though because like introverts and extroverts, like decompress in very different ways. And so the mental health effects of like, I've been thinking about this a lot because I've considered myself like an extroverted introvert. So I need the social Miss, but I enjoyed the homebody Enos too. And it's, it's hard, like from a mental health perspective, I can't imagine that like people who are, you know, 100% extroverted like this is this can't be easy. And you know, for other situations, too. It's, it's been really interesting.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, I definitely count myself in that camp as well. Like, I probably go out like three or four times a week, like in the evenings and then fairly frequently in the morning just to get coffee, just to have some extra time with my wife and not having that. I thought, I thought it wasn't gonna be a big deal because I do enjoy spending time at home as well. But That's that's taken a grander effect than I ever anticipated that I would have. So how do you all solve that? As an introvert it's not a huge issue for me. It's important get out of the house which is funny enough it's like the reverse where I need to just get some fresh air but for people who are extroverts and like neither the company what's the solution? I mean, the best thing I've done so far is just walk the dog so my dog like they've all met Luna she's a little shit and I love her but she has gotten so many walks so many walks and we take her over to the the Seattle Arboretum which is this big, beautiful treed area in the middle of Seattle. And we just do fucking laps around. And so she's getting like, two hours of exercise frequently so that that's helped me a bunch it's it's an excuse to go out. I don't have to talk to anyone. I don't have to get close to anyone and that's been helped. Probably more helpful for me than the dog. The dog is like done at the end of the walk. She's like, why did you do this to me again.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I don't know if anyone else has been doing this, but like I've been doing happy hours with people in the evening sort of holding anyway.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  We're kind of doing that right now. But like I
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  know it was early. I started
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  at six o'clock.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yes.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I mean, it's it's different. You know, it's like a phone call with wine. It's still not the same as going out but it's, it's still nice to have someone to commiserate with. The pitfall you run into is like talking about the Coronavirus nonstop. And so I find myself and be like, Okay, stop, we need to talk about different news, like the anxiety is generally enough. And it only kind of heightens it. So just like scheduling, like virtual FaceTime with friends is kind of what I've been doing so far. And this works. This is good.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, I was really excited for this tonight. Actually, I miss everyone so and I kinda miss Brian. I know.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  feeling's mutual you piece of shit.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  All add another one thing I found also kind of you know, we mentioned the committee. That is definitely nice to cut out. Sometimes for me, I actually don't mind the commute because I take a shuttle to and from work and I actually am very productive on that. So I've actually found I've lost a little bit of that productivity not being hit heads down. But also I've found the ability, I can spend more time with my son like even in the morning, like we all take him out to go for a walk or right after work. It's like, it's really nice to just have that extra time to be able to do that, which is kind of nice, too. That's awesome.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I said, I was like, missing the air like not missing the commute. But I guess in some ways, that was like really good exercise for me, I walk to work a lot or bicycle. And that was kind of like my exercise. And I'm not doing any of that. So I think I'm feeling a little bit like, I have to figure out a replacement for that somehow, like, make more of an effort like Brian was saying, like, go for more walks with the dog or something to like, make up for that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  Right. I like your point. Like, early in the episode about routine because that's something that, again, I'm not working for work but like, I had anxiety to it, it was just, I was like, why am I so anxious and just some days is worse than others and I was like, what's going on? And what it was was the lack of routine. There's like if nothing else if like the world falling apart around you and you just can't get a grip on things and things are just changing so rapidly. Like what you find solace in is routine. But like with a baby there is no routine and like it's and that's what it was and that was extremely frustrating. It's just like every day is random. And I don't know what's gonna happen and like trying to pin down a routine is like number one for me it's just get this get like some sort of schedule in order but I think it would be the same for work from home so like, have routine something that's like you can count on every single day that you do, no matter what happens.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, for me, it's like it's very like primal mechanical, right? Like I have to feel like I did it like I went out and I got the animal I brought back dinner right? Like, I don't know, right? If I need to feel that, like, it doesn't matter that I shipped this giant PR that like fixes I don't know Microsoft's problems, right. But if like I hopped on the bike for 30 minutes like I did something I burn those calories. I don't know.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, like that. That's funny. What have been the major disadvantages?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I forget to get lunch. I like it. I don't know, this is the routine thing again, but like, I'm like working and Josh looked at me today and he's like, don't forget to eat.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  And I was like, well, like Josh.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Josh is good. Is he that good?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Yeah, I want to plus one that I sometimes forget. It's funny because actually at work, I'm kind of the guy that reminds everyone to get lunch. I thought now I forget to get lunch because I've used to like, waiting for people to ask me Hey, are we getting lunch now or something? And, and also along with that, I I myself and I've noticed coworkers they end up working super late. Yes, like they Maybe it's because they're adjusting the schedule. So they wake up later. But it's hard to know. And I just see people work super, super late. And I hope it's not a work life balance thing. And it's probably more of a it's hard for them to disassociate home time and working time because now it's the same place now.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  So do you all have firm working hours where you're just like nine to five or 10 to five or Silicon Valley time, so 11 to two working hours, you're like, Alright, I'm working now. And now I'm done. Just because I've heard that's difficult to separate. Especially when you're sitting at the same desk, you might play video games that you'd like one just involves closing a laptop and when it's just like your laptops open so now that means I'm working.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I think it's really important to have those boundaries. I think it goes back to the routine and you need to set those I remember many years ago I used to work remote for a while I know I've talked about it on previous episodes where I didn't really end up enjoying it because I felt so isolated for like long periods but was one thing at first I was not good at it was just like, well, you just like work all the time. But that's literally what happened because you're just like constantly doing that I even found having sometimes even a separate laptop was helpful. I had like an old personal laptop, that my work laptop was more powerful and probably better, but even just switching to the other laptop for very personal things, or maybe it's even just having your hard drive partition for two different things could work too, is sometimes just that is like, hey, maybe you do want to play games or do illustrations. And that's like on some of the programs that you might be using for your day to day work. Or maybe you like programming, building a side project, just being able to say like, No, I'm shutting off the work notifications, and I'm done. And being able to switch over can be really powerful. I always tell my wife when I'm going to be done with work, so I have someone to hold me accountable. So I say I'm done at 430 I'm done at five and then 430 rolls a clock and she's like all You know, where are you? You said it'd be done at 430. So that helps.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah. What's been tough for me is that I have meetings with London. So I have to get up early for those meetings. And then I have meetings with Australia and Singapore and China as well. And so those meetings come at like six and seven, which when I was working from the office, that those meetings will be taken at home, but it's like, I was home so like, I took the meeting, and then I fucked off right after that. But now it's really tough because like, well as like, I have a meeting at seven. So what am I What am I going to do between five and seven? Might as well answer those like pilot emails. I have to get to. I feel like I'm complaining a lot. Does anyone feel like I'm complaining a lot?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  usual?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  usual? Okay. I thought that was more of a humble brag than a complaint.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  No, no, this is an indictment. Important that I am not managing my time. Well,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  yeah, it's really funny as we're complaining about but the difficulties of working from home all working in the same timezone. Brian bringing that up is that is really difficult, even the remote job that I talked about that I previously went Worked out there was set to two or three hour time difference in the sense that I actually enjoyed because I was up early like no one was even working yet because I was ahead of time at that point, but it caused problem because like, well, you might just work a little bit later because they're all working to you took that meeting that was there four o'clock, but you're leaving into
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  dinnertime. One thing and this is about work from home, but in any remote meeting, I've always had this problem and we were okay. Now, we all know each other fairly well, but it's knowing when to speak. We rely so much on like nonverbal cues of seeing someone's entire body and frame when you're talking to them. And you lose that with remote meeting. So sometimes it's really hard to I've got a really good point but you don't know when to jump in because you can't you don't want to interrupt someone else who's about to start. I don't know I don't solution that
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  maybe Raise your hands. So I know zoom has this feature. And I know other chat clients are getting it is like the raise hand feature. Oh, there it is. Thank you, Augustus for demo. Goodbye. Thumbs up. I okay, well, I'm here.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  But like, that's been effective. Another thing that I think Stacy mentioned, like taking the walk to work or the commute of your walk, I go to a lot of meetings all day. That's a lot of my day. I miss walking to meetings. It sounds so weird and bizarre, but just being able to get up and change locations and actually getting that, I don't know, maybe it's a couple hundred steps between meetings, but you're actually walking doing something. I'm just sitting in one spot, dialing into one meeting, and then to the next and then to the next. It's really boring. You should
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  tell your friends in your houses like conference rooms.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I live in a house in San Francisco though, like there's not many rooms,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  maybe just quarters in a room.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Okay, yeah, I could just have like little like taped off zones and everything like that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  So you can get them added to like the Google Calendar. So it's like Alright, I'm gonna schedule a conference room baby's room.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I like that a lot though. Just pick a chair around the dining table and like to get this one.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  I love that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  Since I am not part of this yet it will be next month. What's the etiquette is like, is it considered rude if you don't have your video on and everybody else does and yes, you're the one person okay?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I don't know if it's considered rude but it's strange with everybody because most people do most people put the video up. And then if someone's not, you're like, huh?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  Are they in the bathroom?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  kind of depends on the size of the meeting. Like we have some meetings that are like tactical meetings with the whole team. And you know, there's really one person leading it it's more of a share out and less of a participation thing and then people without their video on that's not strange to me, because they're sort of just they're listening. not participating, but like smaller meetings I found it's important to, to sort of see everyone especially in this time of quarantine.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Cheers. Cheers. So the reason I say I disagree, which I actually agree it is better to build to see each other. The reason I say I disagree on it is I've been having the challenge of how do I take care of my son at the same time of juggling work, so I may shut off the video because I'm chasing after him and maybe dialed in on my phone. And so there has been instances of that where Yeah, I'm not trying my video for that. Or that my the first week of this of work from home, my meetings, were back to back to back to back. And there was no time to get food. And so some of the times I was actually cooking food and like walking around the kitchen doing that kind of stuff. And so I felt like it would be weird for the person to have to see me moving around that might actually make them sick watching that. So I would shut off my video. So instances like that, where I'm like, well, there might be a reason for it. That's fair. I don't
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  know as as anyone's companies also like it's changed the meeting time length because we've had sort of issues as well with like back to back meetings. And so now we have short so much shorter meetings to allow people like go to the restroom or grab food between meetings. So like no, like 15 minute meetings versus our long and 25 minute versus like, half hour sort of there's like a new meeting etiquette that's being tried out as well.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Yeah, I think that's like a super good idea. And I also actually wanted to mention this as an advantage is I feel people are a lot more mindful of meetings. I have found far fewer pointless meetings, meetings that should have been email. I think it's just because you know, when you are up there and to approach them, you know, you're you really think to yourself, do I really need to set up a hangout for this there there are things that like speaking of disadvantages, we've been talking about work from home, but there's general disadvantages, just not being an office and one of those is imagine starting a new job right now. And like, I wish I could have a conversation with all of you because we've all hung out and
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  you know, for many years now, but imagine your new person starting a team you don't know anybody and you don't know their nuances and things Like that, shout out to those people, man, that's gotta be really really hard to switch jobs. I have an engineer joining our team at the end of this month and shit. It's gonna be an interesting situation so trying to figure out how we can best onboard but yeah, it's gonna be a little weird.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah cuz even like companies that do like all remote they, they still a lot of them still have like I don't know annual get together where they all get to you know meet each other in person kind of thing and it's like that if that components not there yeah that's like there's something to that that makes a difference so that's gonna be strange to start and not actually physically meet anybody for a while
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  before we jump into pics, each of you I'd love to hear what's one piece of advice that you would give to others that may be moving into this world or already into this world where you were having to work remotely or work from home, quarantined. Cheers, cheers. I think
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  My best piece of advice is and like I say this as the laziest shit in the land, as these people will attest to is just exercise man makes such a big difference in my day. And like I like honestly will interrupt my day just to go exercise. It makes me feel better. It makes me like it just everything is better after I exercise. So, if you if you miss it in the morning, then do it in the afternoon, but just figure out how to go for a walk, how to hop on the bike, whatever that ends up being, it helps so much for me, I always try to get my runs in at lunch. So I break up my day and I'm not sitting in my office all day. So every day it's 11 o'clock. I'm out for a run
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  plus one of the exercise it is it It changes your perspective so much like you. You don't even know sometimes you're depressed or feeling anxious until you get out and you exercise hard. You get back you're like I just feel better. I don't know why I just feel better. On the plus side of that there has never been a better time to bike around your city, no matter what city you're in. It is Nice and empty. I've been going to San Francisco like, up and down to Fisherman's Wharf and back it is. It is beautiful. Another piece of advice I would say is, remember how fortunate you are to be in a position where you can work from home like it is incredibly fortunate that we have these problems and sometimes that I feel like this overwhelming you gotta start back to work in a month with the baby and all these things, but I just think it's a good problem to have to be gainfully employed right now and just remember people that don't so it kind of puts problems in a in a different light,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  super plus one to that,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I would say to just with everyone saying like, Oh, I don't have to commute or I have a little bit of extra time. take that time to check in and everybody that you love your friends, your family, especially, especially Now, one thing
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  that's been interesting is like sort of related to what Stacey was saying in terms of like reaching out to people is also like reaching out to people that you work with. It's sort of like it's hard and Especially in this scenario, and everyone's working from home and given the anxiety like just to, I don't know, I found it really useful to be vulnerable with people I work with, like, Hey, I'm feeling really anxious today, I'm sorry that my outputs not, you know, necessarily what it could be. But thank you for bearing with me and sort of it, it helps to not only create sort of like camaraderie and I mean, other people could open up back to you, but also sort of like set expectations. And I find that everyone's been really, really empathetic so far to like, everyone's got, you know, different scenarios going on at home, you know, from being completely alone in their apartment to not having childcare. And it's just been really interesting to have those conversations with coworkers.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Yeah, I kind of just, I guess I was similar to what I was gonna say, but just having empathy for the whole situation. And, you know, the day to day that you typically have with your team is kind of missing. So if you have a chance, just checking in with your teammates. I think it's really important. I feel very fortunate to have a team that like when California announced the shelter in place, order So for those who aren't who aren't from California, this is like the order that officially only essential businesses can be open. grocery stores started going crazy out of stock for everything and it was just really awesome to see. Like my manager and my teammates say, Hey, I'm going to go out I want to be like, I want to be able to have food or something and everyone was very understanding of that. I think
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  for me, another one that I thought was interesting too, is thinking about there are people that can't work remote think about like restaurants, other businesses that are in your area they're local, is like even just thinking of ways to support them is you can actually still right now even in the time that we're all quarantine cheers, cheers. Yes, you can still order food restaurants may not be able to seat you but you can still order food. So like think of that is like can you still you know if you're able to afford eating in and just being able to order it could be a good way to help support businesses to
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  also buying gift cards for like local businesses. As a way of giving back if they're not open now like those gift cards help them with income for now and we'll you can exchange them for goods later.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  At the end of each episode we'd like to share pics of things that we found interesting you'd like to share with our listeners. Let's go around this virtual room to share our picks for today.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I have three today. One is related to my work from home setup they were talked about earlier they're called anecdote candles. And it's it's very millennial the names of the candles are quite entertaining like bottomless mimosas or adulting or mid century modern. They all have they all have like really interesting descriptions like the bottomless mimosas is a smells like, like sunny days and fresh gossip or something like that. They actually smell really good. They don't smell super sweet. So I really enjoy the humor and doesn't smell like being drunk at 11 And then my second pick is actually related to the bike in Brian's house, the peloton app announced that they're doing a 90 day free trial for those who are interested in trying their audio workouts at home. They have like really, really good content for strength training and hit programs. And you don't need the bike to use it. Obviously, like you can do audio work, like runs outside and core workouts at home really runs the gamut. And then the third one is a link that I'll send the group later just because it probably is you put on the website, but it's an article by SF eater, which is just listing some well known restaurants that are open for takeout and delivery. In San Francisco specifically.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, there's a Seattle one as well. It's really good. My first pick you all stole, which was support your local restaurants and stuff like that, but I'm going to take that a little bit step further. I was really struggling with like, people around me were struggling. I'm very fortunate that I work in tech that allows me to work from home. And so how can I have like a visceral impact in my life and so I kind of started thinking through, like, who were like the people in my life. And so I started China's like, Alright, I'm gonna buy a gift card to my barber to my favorite brewery, to my bartender that I really like. All that kind of stuff in just trying to make sure that these people around me like that, that enrich my life and my local community that I'm making sure to support. So that's, that's what I'm gonna encourage you to just kind of take stock of your life. What parts of it are you missing? Who can you support? How can you financially outreach to them and make make a difference in their life? And I think you'll be surprised that the gratitude that you get back from that it's it's pretty, pretty cool. My second pick is a book that I finished reading called talking to strangers. Hopefully no one's picked that in the past. While it's a very good book. It's from Malcolm Gladwell. Which, like my favorite off author, I read everything that he writes. This one was super eye opening to me. It's about just in various capacities like what it's like to talk to people they don't know. Right and it sorry, that's my dog. Hi Luna. Luna is my third pick No, I'm just get that centru So anyway, it's a very good book. It's it has to do a lot with like, unconscious bias, racism, like all these stuff that like you read it and you're like, shit, I totally do that, right. So that one's like one of those books that you read, and it's like, has some altering perspective moments that will change what you look at everything. And then my third pick, last pick, which is not Luna. She's just like the pick overall. My third pick is folding at home, which is a project that's very old, many of you've probably heard of it, and allows you to turn your computer into a analysis engine to see like that. Basically, these like universities like Stanford and Cornell can upload data to your computer, your computer will run like all these analyses and processes. So it's like a distributed supercomputer, and then re upload it to them. So they get to do all these analyses without having like these crazy expensive supercomputers. And the reason why I'm choosing that right now is they're actually running Coronavirus tests right now. So if you want to feel like you're doing something and helping, like I have a gaming computer sitting there, that's, you know, I use maybe once a day for a couple hours, but the rest of day like it's literally running like a, like a fucking wind tunnel because it's doing these coronavirus analyses. So like I hear it, I'm like, I'm doing something and it just makes me feel really good. So that's my third pick, I guess. What do you have?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  So my first pick is a website called encode 2019 dot live. This is just a website that is just, it has global us a bunch of quick facts about COVID-19 in general. I thought it was really impressive because it was made by a 17 year 17 year old kid. And so I think it's worth checking out. I thought it was pretty well done and And props to him for like finding some opportunity to like, you know, do something, you know, during this time, and then my second pick is, I know, we were we were talking about working out how important that is. I was like, I have just the thing for you. But yeah, I also totally agree. I think it's really important to pay attention that, you know, being hauled up all the time inside, you know, don't forget about working there working out and you know, making series stay out, stay physically healthy. So there's this website called blog allottees. And they have this for 14 day quarantine workout. Did you call me? Yeah, it's a really good workout plan.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  So check it out. Ryan, what do you have?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  So my first pick is this book called The mastermind. It is one of the most insane stories I've ever read. It's about a guy who starts off writing encryption. software so he is the brains behind TrueCrypt then he moved into online pharmacy. And then he made the logical transition to being a international criminal mastermind. I mean, guns, drugs, everything. I mean, just the escalation of this guy's what he was involved in is absolutely insane.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, I think Jim's on like step three of that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  Like, like at one point he tried to buy a nuclear sub from North Korea, like that's how crazy he's gotten.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  So gentlemen, step four, okay.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  shrewd negotiators will kill yourself.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  It's just a fascinating story. I couldn't put that actually I was listening to an audiobook and I just I couldn't stop listening to that. The second one is my kind of quarantine pic and it's these sweatpants called a sweatpants. And I do I do get up and get dressed for work but the second I leave at 430 I go throw these things on. These are the most comfortable pants I've ever put on. They're just awesome. And I just love them. And then my Yeah, you said a pants. Yeah, pointy pants. Well, I'm gonna write the company and I'm gonna warranty. They should rename those the quarantine pants.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  There. I'm here for that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
  And then the last one is a podcast episode of episode called reply all. And it's called the case of the missing hit. And a guy writes into the show saying I've got the song in my head and I can't figure out what song it is. And the show is basically the host and this guy trying to figure out what song This is. I mean, they go so far as to fly into LA and hire a band to recreate this song out of this person's head. It's absolutely amazing. I was I listened to it on a run and I was like, bent over laughing at some of these things. It's crazy. It's super entertaining though, and it's a really, really good stories so a lot of button our log files a good one. This this is the best episode of reply all. It's so good.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Stacey, what do you have? first peg just serve what I said before, check in with people, all your friends family. And the I have two music picks. The first one is a band. I think it's just t vam. I don't know if it's pronounced as a word. The song is this is the most tasty pick ever. I mean, the last one was in Morse code, so I still haven't heard from any listeners if they
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  used to I loved it.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  This one's called psychic data by tiveram. He describes his music as post internet motivational slime punk. I don't know if I get the punk out of it, but it's good. It's a good good stuff because you don't understand it.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Yeah. Yeah.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Second one is a song called shedding layers by Rob kluth. Sort of experimental IDM sort of track. If you like max Cooper, you might like his stuff because he's on I think they think he's on max Cooper's label. Yeah, so some escapism, go listen to some music and don't obsess too much about everything about quarantine. About quarantine. Cheers.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Cheers. Cheers, jam. Where do you have for us?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  I've got four picks today. The first one is a show on HBO funny enough. I called Avenue five. When I first watched it, I was like this isn't that funny? I don't, I don't really slow
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  burn.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  It's it is a extremely slow burn. The only way I actually got it was to go back halfway through the season and watch from the beginning when I understood the characters and all that, but essentially it's a show about a space liner which is like a cruise liner but since Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  blue ship Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  cruise ship bad thing. go wrong, and that's probably the best way to put it. It was made beep or beep beep it's, it's really clever. I've heard the best way to watch this actually subtitles because there's so much in every single line like so many jokes and jabs and it's probably one of the cleverest shows I've seen a long while, but I don't think it's going to get season two. It's just not flat out funny. You really have to get invested in it and then it's just brilliant. But worth a watch. If you need something watch, which you probably do at this point. Second one is a show I came across on an airplane or airplane at some point, but it's called a Joe Perry talks with you. It's on Adult Swim. It is one of the most delightful shows I've ever seen. Because one It reminds me of Stacy because it's this guy in the in the Midwest, and he's just like, the most innocent guy in the world. He just like describes life and it's just really, really just it's it's like comforting, it's just watch one episode if you're like, Oh yes, it's for me. Cool. But there's someone out there that's like yeah, this is like really soothing and it's just a good wholesome show and he's just like a good guy and the world around him is completely normal. Everybody thinks he's weird because it's just like such a good guy but just watch it. It's worth watching I really enjoy it. My third pick don't have Valley silicon this week because, you know, we're not out buying things and haven't seen anything crazy. Well, other than toilet paper rushes and thousand dollar days. But
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  mighty Valley Silicon
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  Valley silicon, laser recruiters, like finally busted, busted. I've gotten so many recruiter emails and never mentioned working from home Coronavirus, anything about current events at all in the world. They're all just like, hey, Jem, I saw you didn't get my last email just following up and I'm like, I know. I know. Now that these are all automated I knew before but now I know definitively that they're automated because I've gotten like four or five emails from someone and like, nothing mentioned the current events in the world. So recruiters, come on, like change your algorithm a little bit you know, In my last pick is change slash opportunity. Like it's a rare time in the world, when we get this actually see the world changing and you're aware of it, usually the world changes and then you only know it looking back. But now we're in the middle of it. And we're just seeing tech change. We're seeing the idea of remote work change, we're seeing the idea of people with kids like, these are actually real problems that we just put off for 100 years and like, oh, let let the women deal with it or let someone else deal with it like now, everybody, this is everybody's issue to deal with. And it's really interesting to see how the world changes how Silicon Valley adapts, and which companies survive in which companies don't, and often will, unfortunately, and change often is not pleasant, but the world is changing, but like I guess, this pic, there's opportunity there. Because we don't even know what's going to happen. But you look at stock markets up one day by the same points as down one day by the same point. Nobody knows what's going to happen. So if you're smart, and you're entrepreneurial, This is the time to like make your mark and you can really, really become the next big thing. Because all the entrenched players don't know what to do either. So it's a crazy time to be alive. You know, it's an old curse. It says, may you live in interesting times. Well, this is interesting times, for good or for worse. It is what it is
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  awesome. I have two picks to add. Going off the local business. I've been drinking tonight bear bottle beers, which honestly, is so good. It's a local microbrewery in San Francisco. They always have like an amazing large selection of various beers. And they're always changing it. They're constantly creating new flavors and coming up with new beers to try. So definitely want to say, drink beer bottle if you're in San Francisco. Yeah. And they're phenomenal for teaching people how to homebrew. Like they helped me a lot with my homebrew. When I lived in San Francisco. They're phenomenal community over there. I love that place. That's really cool. I did not know that and I love also Well, right now you can't go you can go pick up But you can't go in there, right. But I also love that they're very like dog friendly, kid friendly, like you can just kind of go there and hang out. The space is really cool. And then my second pick is definitely relative to working from home and have more productivity. It's called coffee tivity. It's a suggestion that someone on Twitter shared with me friend mural, he'd shared this link to basically this app that recreates ambient sounds of cafe. Background noise might be good for you, Augustus, to help you feel like you're in a creative space and you're able to work a little bit better. And I think it is important to maybe not feel so isolated. And so this if you're coding or anything like that, it's a great way to kind of entrench yourself in your work, but not be completely. Like fully immersed in your own world. It's like trying to build stuff around in your own world. Cheers. Good point, Brian. All right.

  you know, the best part of working remotely is I recognize that gem Your eyes are up here, but the party's down here so I can just stare at his beer the entire time and smell weird.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>All</strong><br />
  Cheers. Cheers.
