          <h2 id="heading">We'll be hosting our very first live Virtual Happy Hour!</h2>
          <p>Ever since COVID-19 has taken effect, we've been doing our podcasts online. With our <a href="https://twitter.com/FrontEndHH/status/1245381749435228161">100th episode coming out soon</a>, we thought it would be nice to hear from the listeners (and share drinks with all of you too!).</p>
          <p>Please join us on Thursday, April 8th at 8:00 PM PST on <a href="https://twitch.tv/frontendhappyhour">Twitch</a>. For more details, click <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUGtmAGsS1fk9guBWZbzrxQg6Ef6M2kRraujXoK4Xt8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
          
          <p>We hope to see you there! And remember to stay safe.</p>
