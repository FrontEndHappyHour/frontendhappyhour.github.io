                  <div class="container"><p>Thanks for agreeing to be a guest on the podcast! We’re excited to have you join us.</p>

<p>If you haven’t listened to an episode of <a href="https://frontendhappyhour.com">Front End Happy Hour</a>, we like to keep the podcast as a discussion between the group. So it shouldn’t feel as though we’re interviewing you but all chiming in to discuss certain points. We’ll try and keep it pretty casual.</p>

<p>When we record, we are only recording audio, not video, unless we specifically mention it. Though we may use clips of the video from the call on Twitter, Instgram and YouTube to promote the episode.</p>

<p>Our podcast is rated explicit, so no need to worry about watching your language.</p>

<p>To keep with our happy hour theme we have beverages (cocktails, mocktails, water, La Croix, coffee), whatever you like to drink. In each episode, we also choose a keyword that relates to the theme of the episode that if it’s mentioned we’ll all cheers and take a drink. Do not feel like you have to drink alcohol on the episode.</p>

<p>After recording the episode if there’s anything you realize you aren’t comfortable with something you said going public, let us know and we’ll make sure to edit it appropriately.</p>

<p>On the Front End Happy Hour website, we will list you as a guest linking to your Twitter profile and leveraging your Twitter profile picture. If you don’t have a Twitter account, feel free to let us know what profile photo you’d like us to use.</p>

<h3>What do you need?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Headphones (important so you don’t get feedback from the call)</li>
<li>If possible, an external mic (not needed if you don’t have it, headphones with a mic work)</li>
<li>There will be a link in the calendar invite to join</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recording Remote</h3>
<p>Front End Happy Hour was never meant for us to record remote, but given the situation, with COVID-19 it’s better for us to record remote episodes rather than not releasing episodes.</p>

<p>We like to avoid making things complicated for our guests, but due to us having to be remote we’ve had to rely on having guests do some small setup.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Find a quiet space to record</li>
<li>Turn off notification sounds</li>
<li>Turn off VPN</li>
<li>Turn off applications syncing in the background (dropbox, drive)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Joining the call</h3>
<ol>
<li>Join the call</li>
<li>Make sure your mic and headphones are connected properly</li>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to select that you're using headphones and that your audio and video inputs are correct</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3>Introductions and ending</h3>
<p>At the start of the episode, we’ll ask you to give a brief introduction about yourself. Who you are? What do you do? And what your favorite happy hour beverage is.</p>

<p>At the end of each episode, we like to share something we call picks. These picks are links to something we’re enjoying and would like to share with the listeners. It can be anything from music, movies, tv shows, beverages, restaurants, programming languages, tools, frameworks, etc. (<a href="https://github.com/FrontEndHappyHour/front-end-happy-hour-picks">examples</a>)</p>

<p>At the end, we’ll ask you where people can get in touch with you. Typically we share our Twitter handles, but you can also share websites or other ways to get in touch with you.</p>
<h3>Releasing the episode</h3>
<p>We release our episodes on a bi-weekly cadence on Sunday evenings. We’ll make sure to let you know once the episode is live. Feel free to share the episode on social media.</p>
