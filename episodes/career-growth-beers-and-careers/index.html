<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Welcome to a brand new episode of the front end happier podcast. In past episodes, we've shared thoughts of how to help interns or how to help our fellow teammates. But we haven't really talked about like our own career growth. In today's episode we will be discussing how we think about career growth for ourselves. Let's give introduction of today's panelists.

Jem, do you want to start it off?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Jem young senior software engineer at Netflix,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Stacy London's senior front end engineer at Atlassian I guess this year in,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I guess, senior software engineer at Evernote. Yeah. That's your career promotion. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Grant on

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Congrats. And I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix and he Episode of the front end happy hour podcast. We like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all in the episode, we will all take a drink. What did we decide today's keyword is promotion promotion. So we say the word promotion promoted anything along those lines, we will all take a drink. All right, well, let's jump in. I'm really interested to know before we even get started, what does career growth mean to each of you?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
It means a lot of different things, a lot of different people. So some people see it as making more money, like something very basic like me growing my career means I'm making more money every year. But that's not necessarily what that means for others. I guess for me, I just feels like career growth means I get to, if I'm satisfied, that means I must have had growth that year, or I'm currently in a position that I'm learning new things or I'm able to apply them to cool new projects, stuff like that, like I feel satisfied. If you're not satisfied, maybe you're not growing or maybe you're stagnant. But what if you were satisfied

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
if you were staying Like you were just like, my goal is to coast and do nothing, like literally

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
do the minimal amount. I mean, I worked with a guy whose sole goal is like, I'm gonna go work at a bank and just be like chill and like not have to, you know, nine to five. That's it. This is true. I actually used to have a co worker who was He's like, my, my career growth and goal is to be able to walk from my cubicle to the printer over and over and over as if I'm doing work and get back.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
So, I mean, so if he, if he did that, I guess that's

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
a good like, I've made it.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah. So I mean, but that's still satisfaction in that person's eyes. That's why it could be different. I think also for me, like, when I think of growth is like making an impact or like, being able to almost like increase scope and responsibility, I think, yeah, obviously, money is important. Like, I shouldn't say important, but that is often tied. It's like, Oh, I'm making more money. Obviously, I'm doing better. But I think for me, the biggest thing is like growing scope and responsibilities. really is what I would think of it.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, I guess, like a note. One way I think of regrowth, which doesn't directly answer it is I always think of that question. That career counselor says, like, Where do you see yourself in five to 10 years? And for a long time when I first started working, I totally hate the question because like, No, no, I want to talk about the present I want to talk about now. But actually, as, as I've, you know, started to grow and, you know, work longer, I've realized the value of that question, because you can't really expect like big changes to happen over a period of time, or like, in a short frame of time, like some, some things are like an investment, like, hey, what can I do right now, to get myself the skills to get to where I want to be? wherever that future goal is, like, maybe if you want to go into management or something, you know, what can I do now? Etc, etc.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I think that's good. I always hated that question, too. And I even still do. I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing, like two months from now. But I think if you're like looking, where do I want to be there, it might take you like 10 steps are 10 promotions to get there.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yours.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I think of a career very similar what you were saying Stacy's, like a career is it's kind of your trajectory over life. Like a job is something you're doing immediately a job is something you're getting paid to do. But a career is kind of just like, who you want to be professionally over the arc of your life. For many people, that's they equated to money, which, like, I'm guilty of that too. Like, I think we all are to some regards, but like, I'm really really trying hard not to be that way. Cuz like ultimately, that is a path that will lead you to more and happiness in the long run. Because there's always someone that makes more money than you like, it doesn't matter. You make $100 you're like I made it. What it does is makes $101 I'm like that son of I'm waiting. Like and that's the danger is like, it doesn't matter like there always be someone more so increasing. I try not to it's more like personal development. I think In the day, what am I satisfied doing? Like, am I satisfied with the job I'm doing? Am I an expert at the job I'm doing? To me that's career growth? Am I pretty much sums up to like, Am I a better engineer or whatever I am that year than I was last year. That's me, just like, I like that is

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
that you can actually create a team in your own skill set, even if there's not a level job or anything. It's like I achieve these things. And I'm a better engineer because of it to me on the salary or the money aspect. I think, I've never really cared so much about that. It's more if you feel undervalued, that's my problem is so if you're happy with your hundred dollars, and even though Augustus makes 101 as long as you're happy, and you're like, I don't feel like undervalued just because Augustus makes $1 more, then I think it becomes Okay, it's when it's like, I guess this is paid four times more than you you're doing all his work. That's when you feel like undervalued and I think that's when it's a problem. I think another

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
thing that means growth to me is in my career has been if By have reached some sort of like technical competency or have opinions about how something should be done, but I'm not necessarily in a position to change that at where I'm at. Like if maybe there's, you know, a principal or senior, there's someone who's making a lot of decisions about how things should be done. And if you don't feel you have influence in that, like the growth would be how can I get somewhere where I can have that influence and like, feel like you have more of an impact? That to me feels like growth.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I like that influence.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, as you say that word that's a solid. Yeah, I mean, in order for you to have bigger impact, you're influencing others to write like, I think of it, it's like your own work. If you're just coding one piece of feature or whatever, and it's your work. You have that impact. But if you can impact to like a broader set of like, a whole new architecture framework, whatever you're doing, that's, that's bigger and I think it is influenced that really has that larger impact. I like that.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah. Think of think of a doctor. Like you start off, you're a resident you know, you don't know anything and then you move up eventually come like a doctor, then you specialize a bit more, you might become a neurosurgeon, it becomes spent years being the best neurosurgeon. Eventually, you might become the head of neurosurgery, which means like, you're probably not doing much surgery anymore. You're guiding other people, then you might become like, President hospital, I have no idea how doctors career. Eventually, it's about influence. It's like you are the best at what you do. So now let me help other people be the best at what they do. And in terms of software engineering, that generally goes to tracks as either people management or just bigger architecture management. That's, that's a tricky path that is to navigate and it's, you never know which one is right for you.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
One I think that like Stacy and Jamie both touched on it is like, what are the paths that you can grow on? What are the steps as a front end engineer like what are they? You know, there's, we've we've talked about this on previous episodes like what's the difference between a junior and senior engineer? Is there a mid level are you a lead, are you An architect, are you that principle? Staff gets thrown in there too? I don't actually I never know where it's like, is it staff then principal or principal then stuff? Like I think it depends on the company. But I mean, there's these are natural steps down that technical path where, yeah, maybe you're not a people manager, but you're continuing to influence large groups of people on a technical challenge. And so that can be a large impact or Yeah, you go down the management, maybe it's director VP, whatever that path looks

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
like to think sometimes, like companies that don't have a lot of technical engineering, like pathways for to be promoted. Cheers. There's sometimes this idea that the the the only way to grow is to go into the management path, which is not necessarily the right thing for everybody. So it's very important to be a little bit self aware, to say like, well, I want to grow but that that isn't worried. I want to go

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
right and I often say like, I do not actually believe like management is Promotion Cheers.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Oh, did we pick the wrong radian?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
We're gonna have fun. But yeah, actually don't believe that more because to me, it's just a change. It's a drastic change in your role you're doing something that's a lot different. Whereas moving to junior senior definitely like Augustus just did. That's a promotion. Cheers.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Cheers Cheers to a gusset Wow, golly Geez,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
thanks y'all. I like the track we're taking of managing people isn't necessarily it doesn't necessarily mean career growth in that way. So, like weird sort of history blurb started in the 80s with Reagan in the pro business like state America's and now we're like, you know, this is our people, blah, blah, blah, businesses. We're like, man, Business, Business business, we're making piles of money and like it started in 80s. We need more people who are qualified to be business people, whatever that means. It's very generic. So that's why you have so many with MBAs now. It and that started like A couple decades ago, and but what that meant was if you want to make more money you want to make move up the corporate ladder, whatever, like, you had to be in management. And that's why there's so many VPS and why there's companies like a thousands and thousands of VPS. And of course, had to create a new title, which is executive VP, which means like, You're one level,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
you're another step. 

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Exactly, yeah. Oh, I'm not a regular VP, like it in some companies doesn't mean anything. It's just like, you are a salesperson, they just call you VP because like, you make you feel better. But so that that was like the product, the 80s and the 90s. And what happened in Silicon Valley, like we lost a lot of smart people to becoming managers when they didn't necessarily want to be. They could have been like the world's greatest coders. But you want to move up here in your career, you want to make more money, you need to be in management. Now slowly, like we're shifting away from that there are lots of companies out there like you want to be the principal architect of on AWS or something cool. You can do that. You don't have to manage people and we're definitely starting to understand there are two different tracks on that. But we definitely like that is something that a lot of physicists are still catching up on. It's like, Stacy, you know, you're a great engineer. But if you want to move up, you got to start managing people. And you're like, why I'm a really good coder. I don't want to do that, like, sorry. That's what we got to do. Like, yeah, we're coming around from that now.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah. And I think also, too, sometimes that person who's just an amazing engineer, doesn't translate to being a manager that they're like, oh, they're an amazing manager. They're two different things. It's like, yeah, if you're managing engineers, it helps to be a technical manager, but you're just doing different work. And so I agree with you on that. Jem, too, is like we've, we're losing great people for just like, yeah, just go down this other path. It's like, it might not be the right thing to do. It's interesting, because I feel everybody who kind of goes, moves up, they end up in this maybe this tech lead role. I think that's an inevitable perhaps thing happens. And then it's kind of like a hybrid role where you could be, you could kind of have this decisive moment of Oh, I actually really like the people side. I might I want to go into management or I really hate that people's. And I just want to stick with coding. So, yeah, I've also noticed that a lot of companies have been a lot more receptive about how, like making it like, it's like if you want to move into management, it's a lateral move. It's not like going up. It's actually going horizontal on like, the corporate ladder of some sorts.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I like that word lateral moves. That's a better way to put it

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
for business speak of you.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah. Well, I have an MBA. It's a senior, it's a senior level. Now. It's like,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
you know, I just hear in the

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
waiters, you

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
guys, you know, she's here in the hallways.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
So I'm also interested, we've talked about like, okay, we've talked about some of the different levels or the different paths to like, or even what a career growth looks like, how do you track it? How do you measure that you're actually maybe it's a guesses point of like, here's my five year 10 year plan. Maybe that's easy enough that you have these like stages that you want to hit, but how do you keep track of it, you know? Even that five year plan, you should be checking in on that, right? It's probably not something you're like, well check back in, you know, year five, if I've made it or not. How do you each think about tracking that growth,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I've seen a couple like, I guess, kind of corporate ways of it being done, where you actually have like a career growth plan. And you like, meet with your manager every so often to talk about it. And maybe that's like quarterly or something. And you say, like, in this next quarter, this is like, these are the things that I'm interested in doing. Like, I want to get really good at performance tuning front end, and there's a bunch of stuff maybe I don't know about that yet. But by the end of this quarter, I'm gonna dig into it and learn about it. Here's a book I want to read. Put that on there. Here's like a tutorial I want to do. And just kind of maybe list out a few things and try and make sure by the end of the quarter, you get some of that done. It's more like, like, What things do you want to learn? What are you excited about? And then

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
check in every once in a while, and it's almost like how do you achieve that goal of like being really good at performance. Here's the things that I've listed. I want to do And then the manager and yourself hold yourself or both kind of hold you accountable.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, I don't. And sometimes I don't want it. I do feel like it. I don't want it to feel like pressure from like a manager like, did you achieve this thing? So it really it's more about you. Yeah. And then being like, Hey, I noticed you didn't get that tutorial on. Is there something I could have helped you with in this quarter? Like, did we book everything so tight that you had no chance for self learning and growth?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
at all? I like that too. Because it's they're almost helping you achieve that not saying you have to do this. You

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
said, your plan, not theirs. Yeah, you're kind of like helping them out.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, actually, I like kind of how you touched on. You don't really, you don't really like having your manager kind of like pressure you and I kind of want to bring up the point that, you know, when we think about career growth, we think about what can we do within our own work place and that's not necessarily what you have to do. You can do a lot. You can grow a lot in your career outside of the workplace by contributing to open sources Absolutely. Like there. There have been a lot of technologies I've wanted to, like, get more familiar with. And I've just been kind of doing it on the side like graph qL and stuff, I just want to learn more about it. And, you know, I might not have those opportunities at Evernote. You know, we're exploring it, but now I'm not on that team. But But you know, that doesn't stop me from learning it, I can do it on my own. And so that's something that should be like, you shouldn't forget that.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's such a good point too, because you're right, even if your company is not using graph qL or never explained it, or even if you're not even on the team that's using it, but you're so interested in that mean, especially if the company is doing it, you could just ramp up in that and like, contribute. And then maybe do like, love it so much that you go and work on that team too. I like that. Even now, especially with the rise of internet and free education. And yeah, you know, you could become go from zero to expert, software engineer for free, online, like you don't even college anymore. You can't really put on a company if your career is not growing. I think it's easy to do. And I've seen it people are like, they don't give him the opportunity to do that and like

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Well, there's this thing called The Internet, you make any project you want in any language you want, and you can build as complex as you want. And you're like, Oh, well, I tried that, you know, it wasn't getting any stars on GitHub, I'm like, Well, what are you doing it for? Are you doing it for yourself? Are you doing it for like, fame and glory, because like one is not gonna lead you anywhere one is going to lead to self satisfaction.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
But hey, maybe that's someone's growth like that. Maybe that is their goal is like, I just want to be like, internet famous, I want all those stars on GitHub. And, and so maybe that is a thing. I'm like that, to me. That's not a good motivator is it is just a vanity metric.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
And like, I will espouse all these gems. Wow, thank you, wow. But I'm as guilty as anybody else. I have an ego, the same as everybody else. I am as guilty, all these things. But if you measure any sort of growth or your success in life by any metric that's relative to the rest of the world, then you're going to lose every time because there's always somebody, I don't care if you hit, I'm worth 100 billion dollars. Stacy's worth 100 $1 billion. Like, her yacht is one foot larger than mine, which is a real thing. These are real things. I like billionaires.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I definitely have a yacht. I know

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
you never know. How come I've never been invited. 

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
But how big is it?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, it's it becomes down to the feet, you know,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
which is the real thing. Like, yeah, billionaires spend like, a billion dollars on a yacht to be like the world's largest yacht and they find out someone has they built a 10 foot longer felt like I'm not making this stuff up. Because like when you get to that level, you're like, what else is there? And that's not how

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I see helping society.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I save people from from bird flu. You're like, well, I saved 11 million people from hepatitis, you're like, oh, man,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
you're way better way but no, Stacy's just with her yacht. Like she can. You guys always say that on helping people. I got my yacht.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I respect that. But, like, but that's not happiness. Like at the end of the day. That's not satisfaction. It might get it for you temporarily, but at the end of the day, like you need to measure your measures. So test by your own metrics. Yeah, if but if you measure by money or title or things like that, then you're, you're not gonna win that fight in the long run. So yeah, anyway, the way of measuring career growth is like, it's totally personal. Like, that's the way you should do it. So measuring by influence with GitHub stars, or how many Twitter followers you have,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
so hilariously talking about like GitHub stars and followers, and maybe you want to be someone who's super famous in the community, I had this kind of like humbling moment where I saw someone I kind of looked up to who contributed a lot in open source. He's like a core contributor in Babel. And I was kind of like, I wonder how he like, got to this path of like, getting to where he is now. So I went through his GitHub history, and I think it's a humbling experience. I think everybody should do it, because I step back far enough. And, you know, he started off the same as all of us, you know, he's had like, no personal website, and he had he had like, his own first like little module that, you know, didn't do much, but it was cool. You know, it had like some basic tests and stuff. It's Like really humbling experience, you know, everybody starts the same way. Everybody starts as a beginner, and they just push whatever they want. And, you know, you could see, like, nothing was like crazy impressive, but it was stuff that he really wanted to work on, you know, and he eventually, later he started, you know, he got into a company and it's really cool. You can see like, their career growth right there in like the contribution chart.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That is really cool. And I think I think you put that really well in the sense that I also don't think that that person in particular, you know, you're talking about necessarily, but that person probably didn't set out to be like, I am going to be this like, massive person on GitHub, right? It was like, doing all these things and then finding their passion and just like, keep running with it and like creating something and just like really getting involved with it. And I'm sorry, but like passion, if you're doing something you're passionate about, good things will happen. If you want GitHub stars will probably just happen but like it's it's not the probably the goal or metric to be looking at.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
That's like a secret I didn't come into until my 30s you remember, like This smart person in high school like an auditory so Victorian whatever and you're always like was that you say Santa Claus but it was probably Stacy but but like you, you look these people like Pam they're so smart like this they're so lucky. They're just that smart. And like all through life you you can always think that think like all these people are really lucky. Stacy's lucky she works Atlassian like a world class tech company. She's so lucky. Like, what you don't see is all this hard work and all this passion, all this dedication because like, people aren't going to show you that they're not gonna be like, look at what a hard worker I am like, well, they're humble to the best people are humble. And they like tapping that passion, they exploit the hell out of it. And those are the successful people. Their goal was never to be like real famous or have a 10,000 Twitter followers or whatever your metric for sex is like, just be good at what I do. And good things will happen. Hopefully, you do need a bit of luck here and there. I'm not gonna deny like, yeah, I'm very lucky. But a lot of that is just like it's hard work that nobody sees and nobody will ever see. And that's just how you do it. Yeah, no,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I completely agree. You also brought up like, I think Stacy would even mentioned like talking with your manager? And maybe because I'm a manager, it's a good question. Is it important for the manager? Is it on them to help you with your career growth? Is that a responsibility of a manager? Yeah, I do think at the company for sure. Like, sure. Yeah. Like if you actually report to that person and everything. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, I think so. I think they're, they should hopefully be there to help you understand, like, what the current role you have and what responsibilities you have. And like, maybe if you want to go to that next role, like what does that mean? And how do you get there to like, help you understand what that is? And, and maybe, if they know that, that's where you want to go, they can help you find a project and maybe see like, Oh, do you want to be a lead on that project that will totally set you up for that next thing or whatever, like help you find opportunities or that kind of stuff, I think is really helpful for for a manager for me for my career growth.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I think it's, I think What you said is super important is that I still think it's on the individual to to really, like call that out. Like, don't look for your manager to say what your career growth is, I guess is kind of my thought on that, too is it's, you know, I think of it as my job is to help, like, look for those opportunities, and present them saying, like, Oh, that's what you want to do, like, look to look for those opportunities. But if you're not telling your manager that, hey, these are the types of things I'm thinking about, then how are they supposed to know? They mean? They might think that, hey, you're naturally going down this path and like, look for those opportunities. But I think it's also good to be explicit and call that out, too.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, I was I want to like echo everything you said, like ultimate it a great managers will help you in your career growth. But ultimately, it's like on you to drive that career growth and really voice it to your manager, because, you know, he's not going to drive your career growth for you, right? Like, it's not that's not going to sustain you very long, like if you leave the company, right. Like it's really on you to kind of drive yourself

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
on the flip side, there's there can be I guess, For like the the diversity and inclusion angle to there may be some people that won't demand to be promoted because they feel like inadequate to say so or they don't want to appear a certain way. Like there are some times being a good manager is recognizing that maybe there's someone on your team that's not from the the main, the main group or the you know, the they're kind of on the outside. If they're doing awesome to be like, Hey, I think you're doing really good, here's a good opportunity, and this will help you grow, because maybe that person won't ask for it. So it's recognizing that not everybody is not everybody is assessed the same way when you demand something.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Oh, absolutely. And I guess I'm not saying to go demand it. I think it's more like having those conversations, I think is important. And I know that like some people there definitely are just going to be quieter and shy away from saying something. And yes, like a good manager should try and last those questions and help facilitate that conversation. But I think a lot is on the individual to is like, that's your growth. And like you should help drive that conversation. So, to maybe talk to your manager, you identified some areas that you want to grow. How often are you actually thinking about your career path? I always struggle with this one too. Like even for my own growth is like how often my actually thinking about it, you individually Think about this, I think

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
about fairly often. The danger for me is, if you set some point, say, I've always wanted to work in Netflix like yours ever since I knew like the caliber engineers. I'm like, I want to get there. And then I got to Netflix. So now I'm like, Ah, what Yeah, what's next? What do I do now? Because like I set this like goal and then I hit it but I didn't think beyond that. And it's easy to fall into this trap where like, I will pay it I do what I love I work with like a great company. So like, what do I do now? Because it's so easy to just like I'm gonna kick in my hammock I can do this job because like I've got it down. Like the keep challenging yourself. That's it. That's really, really difficult for me and like, it's so hard to step outside of my comfort zone because it's like, it's always easier not to do something, it's always easier to go home and watch Netflix rather than, like, do some coding or not to like, give a talk or something and just like chill. So I think about all the time, and I try not to, like get myself down if I'm not moving as fast as I'd like. Because that's easy to do, too. You can like get yourself into depression. Even though Life is good. You're like, life is so good, but I don't know what's next. And that's something like I'm really trying to work on now. It's like being mindful, just like enjoying the moment thing for the future. But like, just enjoy it now. So yeah, I think about it pretty regularly, but not so much that I get down on myself. I love

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
that too. Because you're right, you're setting goals that are unattainable. And then you just kind of get down on yourself. Yeah, I would love to own you know, Amazon, that'd be great. You know, like, I'd love to have money like Jeff Bezos and have yachts and stuff, but like, is that achievable? Probably not. And so like if you're you've set out for that you're ultimately just like set it yourself up for failure.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
unfortunate, because my manager is required to ask me. So what are your goals this quarter? I revisit them every quarter.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
But is that is that helpful? Like I think

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
it is because like, 

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think that is like good is like sometimes companies do have these set process in place to make sure that they are checking in and maybe they're held accountable to their managers and etc. So yeah, Is that helpful? 

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I actually do find it helpful. It also helps that my manager, you know, he's not gonna enforce me, he's not gonna be like, Oh, how are you meeting your goals this week or something? You know, it's really on me and he just checks in at the end of the quarter like, okay, so these are the goals that you talked about at the beginning of the quarter. How'd you do? And it's like, then it's on me to really like tell them oh, you know, I felt didn't get to do this much follow law and stuff. So, so yeah, so I, I think it's good to like check in. If you need to check in every quarter. I think it's a pretty good cadence. Personally, I also think it's easy to lose sight of like, I totally agree with You shouldn't set goals. They're totally unattainable, like setting proper goals is really important. But also, don't forget, it's easy to forget all the things you've done the year it's like, I don't actively do this, but it's nice to like have like a little list of like, Oh, these are the things that I did this year. And you can kind of just look back, like, oh, wow, I did. I did a lot,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
huh. Celebrate the wins. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
exactly. Exactly. It's good advice. For me right now, the thing I think about a lot is when you've been in the industry for a while, you wonder is I love the technical track, and I love it a lot. And I've made a lot of my career decisions to stay in it. But then that there's like, for sure an ageism thing in this area where it's it's almost like expected that maybe you go to a manager track at some point in your career because like the I don't, I feel a lot of ageism in this area. And I think there's probably a lot of people that feel this like pressure to not be Technical and go into the manager track because of being at a certain point in your career. So I think about that a lot. And I think, you know, like, should I do that, you know, I do, like, working with people and helping them. But I also still love being technical. So I struggle with that a lot. My career growth is very at that precipice of like, I've done management for a split second. And I liked it. But it's trying to balance that.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, it's a tough one. I don't have an answer for you either. Like even speaking from experience, it's hard to is, I mean, some managers say they code I don't think it's that. It's hard to code and like ship features when you're pulled in so many different directions. And that's not your core of your job. So you're losing that and not that I struggled with, like, really early on, I don't struggle with it as much, but also on the technical side of things. I don't think I could go manage like a design team. I that might not be technical enough for me. So I love being close enough to the code and still care about it and still spend my own time. coding and, or like looking into like what's new and great and like seeing how like we could maybe leverage that on our team. But yeah, it's not it's not the same, you're not shipping like features to production anymore. And you miss some of those chasing down that crazy bug that you're like, oh, why is this not working? So it is a hard, hard decision to do. Like, what's tricky is real career growth. It never looks like it. Like at the time, like you will never know.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
For instance, I was like, Yeah, I've always want to work in Netflix. But I never thought like, here's this path. How many if there's just like, here's like, my end goal. You didn't plan for that. I didn't plan you know, I didn't plan for it. Set up the trap and yeah. But I was like, you know, I like talking to people I like sharing I like teaching. So let me do that because like I'm okay with that. So I do that do that and then you know, that path set me on this trajectory to end up at Netflix because you know, we met at conference polyglot Wi Fi tell that story a million times already. But At the time, that was not my angle, it was just like, I'm gonna be do really good at this and give like a really, really good talk and just like, really, really helpful in the community. And then like that ended up this other series of events. And so I think at the time, like you never know, that weird library you're working on that you're like, this isn't gonna do anything, but like, I'm really passionate about it. That might take off. Like, I'm not saying these are all lottery tickets or anything, but it's just, I think, if you like, live more in the moment, do things that you're passionate about. You'll look back in three years and like, Oh, ah, I ended

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
up here because of this, this this and this, like, there's no way you could have planned that roll even talking back to the Babel example is like, I'm sure there's like other like things that this person was passionate about creating. And they did and then they were like, Oh, well, there's this like cool thing to transpile JavaScript and like, allow us to leverage new features in the browser. All right, cool. I'm gonna work on this and then others like get attracted, hidden This person is passionate about it. And then like it all kind of like spins off of that. So I think that's well put is that you don't always necessarily do something in order to get like this end game. It's just like, in the moment you are really passionate about it go for

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
it goes back to that like gear and you feel satisfied, you're happy in that moment, you're doing things that you enjoy. You're learning, whatever, like that moment that matters. And that will lead you to better things and unintended growth, right?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
The counterpoint to that is you can't pass up opportunities when they hit you. You can't, like there's a date like you don't want to be too comfortable to like you should be comfortable, happy, but not too much. So where someone's like, hey, I've got this crazy idea. You want to try this with me and you're like, Ah, no, you know, I got my thing going on. I don't really want to try anything like outside my domain. I think that's an easy opportunity in this and like life will pass you by really quickly. So if you see an opportunity, jump on it. But again, also live in the moment and like, I know it's like counter advice because it's really really hard to like, think about the future, but also live in the moment. But like, That's life, that is the balance of life that we all do. And if it were easy, everybody be happy and smiling around and all these things, but like, we're not so we do the best we can. So I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
think we've definitely sprinkled some advice here. But like before we go into pics, what's like one piece of advice that you would someone comes to you like, what do I do for my career growth? What is the one piece of advice that you would share with our listeners?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
For me, I think it's been if you really like, let's say, front end development as an example, you really like that. And that's something that you just super enjoyed doing. And every if you're at a place that is continually like trying to make you do other things outside of that, my, my, the best thing that I've ever done is just said, You know, I don't think if I stay here, I'm not gonna be able to do the thing that I love, and move and move on and find a place that will value that, that you like doing that thing and they want you to do that thing. So I think that that's the biggest piece for me. And that's By doing that, that has ended up salary increases, because you've moved to a different company, more opportunities to do the thing that you actually care about. So, I guess kind of like, Own your career, don't just get complacent and say, Well, I guess I'll just do everything they asked me to do. Like, it's your choice and your happiness is a little bit you know, you own that. And

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, it is not easy to move jobs. No, it's not so hard. I think knowing that you're like, Alright, this isn't for me and being able to make that call. That is definitely a good one.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So I'm gonna do things the lazy way, because like, that's the preferred way of doing it. That's an engineering way. Oh, yeah. as lazy as possible. And the laziest way to manage your career growth is pick friends and be friends with people who are ambitious and smart, and humble. And like that are also like trying to be better engineers or being the better at whatever they can. And if all your friends around, you are rising up, they will not pull you up with you like a Nazi. gonna hire you or anything like that, but like, they will inspire you. But if you pick people who are like, yeah, you know, I could interview at Google, I'd probably nail that. But you know, I'm just too busy. You know, I can't do that. But I probably could. Like don't pick friends like that, like, you can't choose your family. You're stuck with them, but you can choose your friends and your friends like really influence your career trajectory. I wouldn't be where I am. If I didn't work with like, some really smart people will tell me a bunch of things. So that that's really important. And I think

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
it seeds into the passion too is like if you work with even if you're not passionate about something that someone else is, it just like wears off on you as like, you're like, Damn, I love that that person just went and created Babel and like, wow, that's impressive. I'm not really super stoked on that necessarily to work on but if that person can do it, maybe I should go create something and I think that helps really feed and drive some passion.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
It takes no effort. Like to be friends with someone and see like, oh, cc is really an engine x turning on. Like that's, that's interesting, but she's been talking on yachts, and yachts, super yachts are mega yachts or whatever the mega yachts. But like he, you're friends with people like that you hang around them long enough and you see like they're driven, they're passionate. Like I said, like that does rub off on you and that you're like, Oh, I should be ambitious because like, this is how you be in life if you want to be successful and like you work hard to be ambitious, be humble. I

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
want to echo like a lot of the things like surrounding yourself with a lot of actually. Yeah, I feel I've grown a lot in my career because of this podcast. So

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Ah, thanks. I guess his

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
promotion.

promotions. Yes, but yeah, so I'm pretty happy. I think another thing is, you know, it's also there's this kind of stigma that you have to figure out where you want to be, like, immediately, like, I remember when I was in high school, it's like, people are already asking, oh, what major you know, Major, and it's like, I don't know, this is like stigma to know where you're going to be and I think it's totally okay to not know if you don't know where you want to go. Just do what you love. And you'll find your way there. I think it's totally okay to like, just start with something small. And being honest with yourself like, Well, you know, I don't know what I want to do, but I really like this, and just kind of going off of going from there, you know, you'll you'll be surprised where that ends up. And I think like setting really like, like, really achievable goals. At first, like, I definitely really, you know, resonate with the idea of like, you know, where do I think where do I see myself in like 10 years? And you don't have to necessarily be like, Oh, I see myself as like a senior software engineer to see yourself as like, oh, where do I want to be? Do I want to be like working in tech still? Or do I want to have like a family or something? And then just really think about, okay, what do I need to get to that? And then you can start like distilling it down like, Okay, well to get to there. What do I need in five years? And then what do I need in a year? So just break it down.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Alright, this is really hard to follow all this great advice, but I'm actually going to go a little bit different than states. I'm also going to, even though I agree a state advice of like, when you're passionate about something like front end, go for it and just stick that I agree with that. But there are instances where you might not really sure like, you're like I love engineering, but I don't quite know what my niche is or what I'm like super excited about is like, I think being okay, or being open to going out of your comfort zone is super helpful to like, I love front end, but I've definitely done some back end, I've done some mobile and different things. And it's like over the years, and it's kind of almost helped me be better in front end sometimes, because you see different ways of doing something and it can really help you. But it also gave me the opportunity to say like, is this for me? Nope, love front end and go back to it, which is kind of cool, too. So I think it kind of plays off. Here's a little bit safety, not saying that your advice is bad.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
No, I think and what I could amend what I said too, is I think the reason that I maybe knew that I really liked it was the fact that I was asked and did a bunch of other things.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
kinda knew that I was like, I don't like I know Stacy did

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
all this early like writing Java batch jobs. You

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
tried it and you knew that. And I think that that helps you. And this

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, like anytime that you can get the opportunity to try something to really understand is this for me, it might truly be, even though you thought this other piece was so great. Yeah, when I think back to my career, and why I've, like lasted as long as I have and not, you know, just given up on tech because it can really burn you out. It's been it's been people along the way. So I've like, had an amazing mentor when I first started or someone that I trusted that helped me or someone that helped lift me up and give me good advice. Like, along the way, there's always been someone like that at all the various places that I've been. And so my career advice to to anybody, especially that if you've been in a while is to pay it forward or pay it, pay it back, to look out for that person that is just starting in their career and maybe try and be that like mentor or be For them, and I think that will make a lot of difference to other people's growth in their careers.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right at the end of each episode, we like to share pics of things that we have found interesting that we'd like to share with our listeners. Let's go around the table and share pics for this today's episode. The guests swear to God. Sure. So my first pick is Silicon Valley Smash. Ooh, what is Silicon Valley smash? Yes.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
So, Netflix and Twitch have partnered up to have host a smash meetup. They're going to be playing Super Smash Bros ultimate. It's on the Nintendo Switch. And I think they're having like a little mini tournament. And I believe I heard somebody is casting it. I believe Twitter's casting it That's true. They're live streaming. But I think one of the people here might be a announcer I

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
believe on my yacht. I don't know.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
But you could probably live stream from there. But yes, Gemma will be one of the What do you announcer or commentary? commentator that's a good

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
way to put any and Michael Paulson who was on episode about three, three episodes. Go for it. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
three, four episodes ago. Yeah. And actually Michael Paulson's, the one who organized this all work with twitch on this and yeah, I'm excited for it.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So if you live in Silicon Valley, hit us up for an invite.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, the merrier. There'll be a link, but it's in April. Hope to see you all there though. Yeah, I'm hopeful. Hopefully I get into compete. Yeah, I did sign up. And then I have two more picks kind of related. One is chrome 73 update. Lots of really awesome stuff. One of the really cool things is you can now install pw A's from like, Chrome on Mac and which is really cool. So I went to mobile.twitter.com and I installed the pw A. So now like, I just go to my desktop, click the Twitter icon and it opens up mobile. Twitter's just so cool. So

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
that was nice to see. Apple doing that. That's Yeah. So it's so great.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
kind of related to that is three JS slash editor. So three GS is this JavaScript library that makes it very easy to do Web GL Canvas graphics. And they have this editor, which is super slick. It's like a wiziwig. Basically, it's like cinema 4d, on the browser. And they made it into a pw a recently. So I was able to like, go into Chrome, put it on my desktop. Now I have a three JS editor. So I can create like 3d graphics. And then like, in like Web GL, no, just spit it out. It's like, it's crazy. It's awesome. Check it out. That is so cool.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right, Stacy, what do you have for us?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Alright, I've got two picks. The first one is something seemingly very silly and simple, but quite amazing when you find out that it exists, the ability to do screenshots really easily within within Chrome. So if you do Command Shift p, just like you would in a lot of your editors to like bring up a command palette, just type screenshot. And there's like three options. You do like a full viewport and I actually like scroll and take a screenshot. The entire webpage, just your viewport or even like a note, if you're like maybe doing a pull request and you want a picture of like, just a small piece of the page that you've changed, you can like get a screenshot of that. Super nice, super easy. Wow. So I have an extension in Chrome that does the whole scroll through. I did not know that there is a option already. Yeah, I was just gonna say when I started Evernote, I remember you told me to use this to suddenly Yeah, wait. Yeah. Anyway, like, Hey, you know, submit the screenshot to QA to verify. There you go. So easy. That's awesome. I think it does max out, like so many so many lines. But it's a very, very long webpage. So mostly, your webpage shouldn't be that long. And yes. So that was the first one which is cool. Also, by doing that, command, shift p, typing in whatever you're thinking about. It's just brings up amazing amounts of stuff that's built into dev tools that maybe you don't even know about. Well, I need to play around with this, like type in performance. Whoa, all sorts of cool stuff in there. And then second pick is Daniel Avery's album. Song for alpha it's not a new album as in 2018 but it's just a really good like techno album to code to. I really, really enjoy it. Awesome. Jem What do you have

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
to add? That's my programming programming list. Three picks today. My first pick is the CASPER glow light. Very unusual for me. I know it's very antithetical for my traditional fix because I guess you can lump this under smart home but it's not connect to the Wi Fi so I don't consider it a smart home. It's just a nice to have but what is is a glow light from Casper who's largely knows the mattress company but it's a light that it sits on a stand that you can take it with you. If you flip it over it goes a full brightness, you can twist it to adjust it in this. If you want a nightlight you pick it up and you give a little shake and it gives off a nice glow. It's really nice for a night if you're like I want a snack, but I don't want to like step on the cat or something like that. You just like pick it up off the stand. You take it with you. You set it down. You bring it back. It's like it seems so simple but It's like really, really cool and my, my wife is like really happy with it. So I ordered another one so you can all sync them together.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's even cooler.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
It is a little Silicon Valley and they're expensive. It's $99 for light and you're like it's a light like whatever but if you have the money it's pretty cool. It's it's very useful especially for like if you have kids or pets or something like that. My second pick is the Oakley prism glasses. It's a lens technology that enhances color. And like I really it's it's hard to describe it but I have a pair and it makes like green more green. So I'm driving home today down the highway. And just like the world is beautiful with these glasses because like the green just like pops and like when the sun hits it, it's like this bright neon green you're like wow, this is so so cool. Waters bluer.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I can attest this, he actually let me wear them. We're on a boat in Mexico and I was like, Whoa, it made a huge difference. Everything looks so like vibrant.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
We're Funny enough, we ran into some we're gonna go snorkeling. I know we sound like a bunch of riches that are in a boat in Mexico circling. You weren't on my yacht but I know you didn't buy something. Yeah. I will remember that Christmas though. I but they're like, Oh, we can't go snorkeling because red tide, and I put on the glasses, I can clearly see the red in the blue versus when I took them off. I'm like, I can't see anything. It's kind of hazy, like adult red, but it just makes Colour Pop. The idea is like if you're cycling, or doing some sort of action sports you want to see like crisp details. It's pretty impressive technology. I'll give it to him. And my last pick is it's a Netflix original, called love death and robots anthology series. There's about 18 of them. They're completely unrelated. The story is they're mixed they there's no theme really other than love death and robots. But what I love is the animation styles are like all wildly different. And it's just impressive. If you are a fan of animation, or if you're not at all, it's just like the different styles are so so cool. Just like technically amazing like they capture human movement efficiency. Are there facial features like so? Well, it's worth saying, Yeah, that's my fix. Right on.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I actually have three pics as well. One is going to be iOS Apple photos with iCloud. I'm like blown away how seamless This is, is the fact that I have a lot of photos and they take up a lot of space. And it's always Where do I save these photos if I save them on my MacBook and on my phone, and then I'm like eating up all this hard drive space. iCloud in photos like this is really like seamless thing where it's like, will save them to the cloud. And then almost like a low grade version of it on your devices until you actually want to see it. Like if I click into a photo, it will download that and eventually get rid of it. So it's like it's optimizing to not take up a lot of space. I was like blown away. I was like this is actually really nice. I feel like it's been there for a while. But I've started using photos again like it's been you Like I used it back when it was like iPhoto. And so I started using it again and I'm like, Alright, this is pretty impressive. So I've been using it on my MacBook and on my iPhone, it's, it's kind of nice. It's nice. And then I have two Netflix shows. For anyone that's a parent working moms is hilarious. It's a show on Netflix. And it's actually a Canadian show, which is really cool. It's filmed in Toronto, so it gives me a little bit of love for like, seeing Toronto makes me miss Toronto. Not the cold, but the show is just hilarious. Yeah, I highly recommend checking that one out. And then the Oh a season two just came out. And it is better than the first season. Well, I think Yeah, like, I feel like it has more depth. And even better. It's filmed in San Francisco. So that's really cool too, is like oh my god. So I've got my Toronto City pic. And then San Francisco on and it's like, I honestly think I have not done this season yet, but I'm quite few episodes in and it's just the story is going in so many different directions and it's getting so much more interesting. So I highly recommend checking that one out.
