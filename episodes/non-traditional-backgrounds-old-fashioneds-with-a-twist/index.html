<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Welcome to a brand new episode, the front end happier podcast. In today's episode, we're covering a topic that I know we've been asked many times to do. And I'm really surprised we haven't covered it in the past. But in today's episode, we're joined by David Zimmer from Netflix to talk with us about non traditional backgrounds. David, can you give a brief introduction of who you are, what you do, and what your favorite happier beverages

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
for? Sure. So I, as you mentioned, I'm a senior software engineer at Netflix. I am working in particular on Graph QL Graph QL tooling right now with my team. And I've already forgotten what you asked what the seconds

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
okay, I mean, you've covered the you've covered your who you are and what you do. Now, what is the most the most important part what is your favorite happier beverage?

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
Alright, the my favorite. And what I have in front of me right now is a Ryman Hatton.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Ooh, that was really good. Fancy.

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
aroma and sweet. Yes. And this, which is a very important part of, you know, choosing.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I feel like when you're making a cocktail, like there's something about that is like it needs to look good to like I always am, like, happier when I've made it really nice looking, too. Absolutely. Yeah. So that's really good. All right. Well, let's also give introduction of today's panelists. Surely you want to start it off?

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Yes. Hi, my name is Shirley. And I'm an independent creator of data visualizations. And currently, I am very jealous of Dave's drink.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Jem, Jem Young Senior Software Engineer at Netflix.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix and each episode of the front end happier podcast, we like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all, in the episode, we will all take a drink. And what do we decide today's keyword is background? Background. All right. So if we say the word background, which I'm pretty confident we will, we will all take a drink. So I figured when we jump in and start talking about a non traditional background, cheers, cheers. What does that all mean to you? I think setting a baseline is really helpful to understand that.

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
Sure. One thing that came to mind right away was being self taught. But of course, like there's such a wealth of information online, right, everybody is just like gleeful to teach others about what they've discovered what they learned and how to build it. Like, like, I learned a ton of what I know, actually, from gem like, I took one of gems courses, and I've read articles written and all that kind of thing. So self taught, definitely. But of course, we're all sort of standing on the shoulders of various sized giants, you know, as we're teaching ourselves. So it's not fully ourselves. But definitely being self taught is a big part of it.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think, though yourself in the sense that like you weren't going to class every day, and having someone teach you everything you had to like, seek those things out, like, where do I go learn this? How do I find gem online? And I mean, that's what we do. If you want to learn you go find gem online, but it's still work, you got to do

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
very hard to find anything. So it's all finding gold mines. That's a David, that's probably why you haven't gotten a promotion in a couple years. Because you know, you've learned for me so essentially nothing you've learned nothing.

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
I shouldn't ever say your name whenever I was interviewing.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah, that probably actually knocked you down a few points in their mind. They're like, Yeah, you know, poor judgment. But you know, it seems like a good guy. So we'll give a chance. I think, when people say, self taught or things like that it has such a negative connotation. But as someone with a CS degree, most of what I learned is self taught as well. Like, like, honestly, like CS degrees in general. Or maybe I'm speaking to my school, but I think in general, do not prepare you for the real world of coding at all. They give you like background, shares, tears, they give you like fundamentals and things like that on a broad swath of topics. But yeah, you get your degree and you get out into the real world and you realize it's not worth anything. I mean, it's not worth nothing. But I'd say it does not help you, other than making it a little easier to find your first job. So yeah, if people were self taught, I'm self taught, like, Yes, I have the grip of like, everything I know is from independent learning on my own.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I think that I will agree with a lot of what you're saying, Jem, I don't have a CS degree. But I did take a community college degree for like a two year program that was really focused around web like, which is cool. It was like this new thing that you know, what does it mean to do web development and it was kind of even covering like design and web and all the things and what I feel that that did for me was exposed me to some of the things did I walk away from that having really all the knowledge? Absolutely not. A lot of it was on me to then go out and figure out what are all the things I need to know to be successful and be a strong engineer. One thing I did really appreciate from this course was you got a two month on site practicum, or internship. And that to me, and that two months time, I felt like I learned more than I ever did in class. And I don't think that that's fair that I didn't learn in the class part of it, it was just in the sense that I had the fundamentals that had been kind of built up along that time. And then now I'm thrown in the mix of this is how you actually do all the work and deliver to a client. But I still felt like throughout my years of growing as an engineer was seeking it out myself and learning and growing that way.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I have a question. I wonder hearing what everyone's saying. I wonder if it's that this is particularly true that let's say our, you know, computer science classes were more much more like theory based. And then we learn a lot more from like practical applications on our job. I wonder if this is particularly true, because we're front end developers, like, I do think that some of my friends that, you know, went and went into back end development, I mean, I do think they learn a lot on the job, but also what I feel like there are like, the computer science course works were probably a lot more useful for them, because they were like, you know, the database design, and like, the computer architecture or distributed systems. And I wonder if it's that a lot of traditional computer science programs are theory heavy, but also much more geared towards that back end, because I think historically, that's just been around for longer. I'm kind of like halfway in between, I studied business as my major. And then I did a computer science minor. So I was like, in that weird place where I feel like I like knew just a bit. And then I like, had major imposter syndrome on my first job, because I was like, Oh, my God, everybody here knows so much more. And I'm lacking because I don't have a computer science degree, like a major degree. And then years later, I find out that that's not the case. That's in the side, sorry, I'm trying to say is that while I was doing my computer science classes, I took like a side elective that was web design. And it's like this thing called a decal on our school that was like student taught, which was really interesting. So it wasn't even web development wasn't even part of the actual computer science curriculum, but was something that like students thought was interesting and taught a class themselves. But I think now there's think there's more and more programs that also teach Front End Web Development. That's, that's my kind of guess

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
that's exciting to hear your variation on that, surely, because my mind feels almost kind of similar is that I went to school for something else entirely. And I happened to get a job in the audiovisual slash IT department at the college, which is where I discovered that the school's website was ugly and horrible to use. Change it even though I didn't know how yet, but I, but I did so. And then, while I was still on my other career track, I really like working on this web stuff. And so I did it on my own. And then someone said, Hey, can you fix my website, and I knew just enough how to do what they needed. And, and then things went in parallel for a few years until I realized I hated what I went to school for. Thing is actually really fun and enjoyable. And I'm just going to do that instead. And yeah, but it was, like, even less efficient than yours. But it was kind of this minor on the side. While I was mainly focusing on this other

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
thing. What were you doing before moving into engineering?

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
Sure. So I was on the track to be a chiropractor actually, fully, like went all the way through grad school, it was in practice for a couple years. I wish I'd had better career advice before I made that choice. And then, you know, got all those student loans and everything. At the time, where where I figured out that I didn't want to do it anymore, which of course, I could talk for hours about the reasons why and, you know, that's, that's either it, I'll leave it to you to decide whether it's an interesting story or not, but but it's a it's a complicated one. But when I left, I left because it was something that I couldn't do in good conscience anymore. And when I when I had to figure out like, what was I going to do next there was like, Well, do I go to medical school? But that's another 10 years easy and another huge pile of money and is it too late? Maybe it's too late? Maybe I should do that. So while I was exploring those options that felt more like aligned with what I had originally had as a plan for myself. This this will this website thing I could do kept creeping in and it was actually kind of hard to get to that decision of. I don't have to do what I went to school for it. It was really hard to finally say that out loud. But once I did so much more freedom and You know, that kind of that's the like the rest of history point where we're,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, I love that too, because I feel like that that is a big barrier. You've invested so much time, and then having to make that decision. That's tough even though it's, well, I'm pretty sure it was the right choice for you, I'm assuming. But that's a scary thing. It's like, Hey, you were interested in this one thing you've invested so much time, and now you're something else is pulling you away. And that's a that's a scary risk. Because it is a risk. You don't know if it's gonna pay off or not. The risk,

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
the sunk cost feeling is real.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I think, surely, I'd love your point about traditional CS degrees being focused on that in and algorithms and things like that which aren't applicable, or they are applicable to the front end, but not as much, I would say, just because the the nature of the work we do, it's important to note, we're all roughly the same age group, which is a big difference, someone 10 years younger than us will have a very different experience. But from my perspective, I won't ask it held everybody else. But from my perspective, when I was coming up deciding on a career, kind of like, like David wasn't trying to pick, what's the path I follow. Being a software engineer was it was like a thing. But it wasn't. It wasn't. There's the glamour and the pay. And like all the accoutrement we have now was not there. It was just like, I'm passionate about doing this. And like, Oh, cool. If it pays, it pays. If not, this, the career I've chosen, that is very different from the world now where people graduate college, and they're like, where's my six figure salary in my unlimited PTO and stuff like that? So, yeah, it's I think it's important understand, like where we're coming from when we say like, our backgrounds, because the world is very different. Now, boot camps did not exist. When I was I was coming up.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I don't think front ended when I started. That was not a thing. I don't know when that's fully became a thing. But it definitely was not. When I started, I think what

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
development was a concept. And I guess my first job was as like a, I think my official title was software engineer. But the understanding was that I was working on front end development. So I think by the time I was graduating in 2012, I think it was starting to become a thing can I want to share? I'd like to, to Jem's point, one of my favorite still one of my favorite quotes from my syllabus for my intro to computer science class was like I had this like super snarky professor. And there was this like, two sentences in there that was like, if you are looking to get rich from this computer science degree, you are looking in the wrong place. This is no longer the gold rush of, you know, the early 2000s. And if you're just you should go over to the business school and do investment banking, like all of those other insert, you know, some snarky, that was like, Oh, crap, that was me. I was in the business school, and I was gonna do investment banking. And then I was like, Oh, no. And then I went, so do you see us instead? So yeah, just just as an aside story, my favorite story about 1210 12 years ago, where the state of things

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
was, I guess to is, like, you know, we've established that we've all come at it a little differently. And you know, maybe the non traditional piece of it is there. I'm curious to hear some of your thoughts on like, what was challenging maybe not having fortunate enough like jam having the full I guess surely got the half CS degree or the minor in its and jam having the full but I'm curious, like, even maybe, David, what did you find the challenging pieces, maybe not having that non traditional background, I was trying to skate around that part of it back

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
tears,

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
they're, they're like challenges along the way. And then there's once once you are someone who has now has a traditional or an untraditional background, then there's like, there's other challenges now. So the ones along the way, I think are ones that some of you alluded to, of not having a teacher to kind of be like, here are the core principles you're going to need to know that are that are going to help you understand other things. I think I think a lot of the other things are in this might be continuous throughout the whole process is this feeling of inferiority? Oh, you know, I didn't go to school. For this. I didn't get a degree, feeling like others are further along at a younger age. We colleagues, you know, who are awesome at what they do. And you know, we made even the people that that are good at similar things to, to, to what I'm good at it, but they're 10 years younger, and and then that creeps into the feeling of like oh, imagine if I had like if I had figured this out eight years earlier, how much farther along the you know how much more tech company stock I'd have. It's like, it's almost like an a multiplier for imposter syndrome is not only not only am I in this crowd, and everyone's awesome, but also like Oh, They must be way awesomer because, you know, they have these like advantage to start with, or they got started earlier. Yeah, I think on the on the knowledge thing to like not having a teacher to set you there. And a lot of those things you can learn, but also there's at least I found there were there were holes, these these kind of gaps in my knowledge that I didn't figure out until seemingly later. But Jem, you mentioned that a lot of back end concepts aren't necessarily don't necessarily translate to what we do on the front end. And that I think, is totally true for like, a lot of CSS and design principles. Like I've always, I've always done both kind of the design and engineering halves. And so I was able to get pretty far by making things look really good, even when I didn't understand how to engineer them well. But there's things like, you know, the principle of, of, you know, like an old one lookup time, if you make a map out of data structure, instead of filtering to the list every time we principle like that, which is, to my understanding fairly basic computer science. I was aways along before I sort of either noticed it or notice that oh, I need to know that. Oh, that's why that works. So well. And and then how to apply it. So yeah, you got kind of this haphazard path towards the core pieces that you might have gotten in place right away. If someone had sat me down and said, here's the things you need to know.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think you explained it. So Well, David, I was exactly how I felt where there was like I achieved it in some way, but wasn't aware of maybe a better way to do it, or like that fundamental way, it's like, this is what you should be doing. Or, you know, it was just like a hacky way to get it, you know, like it works. And it's like, but not necessarily knowing the best way. And to the imposter syndrome part of it. I'm like, I mean, it still bothers me where I'm like, Well, I don't have a CS degree. And it's like, does that matter even now I know, I can tell you, it does not matter. But I still face that day, on days where I'm like, I wish I had it, I think it would have maybe given me some of the knowledge a lot easier. Versus now I've throughout my career, I've just gone and learned it. And I've even gone back to the fundamentals to make myself stronger for that. But it was just more like I had to push myself to do that. Rather than continually fumble along, the fumbling was working, but I could probably no more of these fundamentals,

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I really appreciate what you said about having someone to guide you of, because I feel like a lot of the struggle in computer science is like, it's such a different mental shift and different way of thinking from how we kind of normally think about the world. And like, I feel like the biggest struggle is knowing not knowing what you don't know, like as in like not knowing you don't know something, so you don't even know where to look. And then I think that along with like, I think some of the, I think the most important parts of learning is like making connections between like, I feel like when we're self taught, we like make, we learned so many disparate things that are actually all interconnected. But we don't know that they're connected until we kind of like someone comes in and gives us a framework or I actually had a really interesting talk with my husband, because he actually switched from mechanical engineering to data analysis. And we were talking about how there were some things that he learned in college, some statistics classes that he learned that's like, you know, really helpful now, but he I thought he made a such an interesting point of like, when he learned it, then he didn't really care about it as much because there wasn't as much of a practical application to them. So he was just like learning the concept and learning the theory for the sake of learning from a class. And it didn't really stick because there wasn't something practical to like stick it to. But now that he has the like data job, and he has to use those, like stats concepts. Now he's like, okay, these actually are making sense now. And I was thinking about it for myself to where this more is more on the design side. But I realized that there was like, a few years where I was just like doing things without having like the framework. And then once I went back into like, kind of self teach myself, like the design side, and like learn those frameworks. That was when like the connections were made, and it made so much more sense in my head, then, I'm guessing if I went to a class for it, because then I already had the disparate pieces in my head. And that kind of that learning that that teaching moment was just about connecting all those disparate pieces for me.

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
Totally. It's like the scaled up version of the difference between just reading a tutorial quickly and through and building the project yourself. Oh, yeah. But, but over the span of years and your career, like your education.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Oh, yeah, it's a great analogy. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, you need to apply what you've learned because I I definitely think reflect some times where I've just said earlier, I want it or like, Oh, I wish I had the CS degree, but then there's times that I'm like, would that have helped me I'm not sure because like if I just went into school trying to learn that all I don't know that I would have understood why I'm learning this. I know if I went and did it now. And I'm like, no, why I'm learning these fundamentals. But I don't know if at that time it would have helped me like I actually might have dropped out like, would have been like, I don't really like this. So I don't I don't know, I always think about those things.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
If I could go back in time, I would prefer to work as a software engineer and then get my degree. It's exactly like you're saying, David, and Shirley and Ryan, you're just getting stuff thrown at you. And you don't really see the application. But like, because of the US education system. Like that's how you learn. It's just beaten into you. It's like, why do I need to know, cursive? Because they told you to and like, that's how it is. And that's how it is getting a degree. I think it's just, why do I need to know what a red black tree is? Because I told you so. And you're like, okay, so yeah, like, I'd say, 90%. And stuff doesn't stick with you. It just gives you like a taste. And it gives you so like, if it comes up again, you're like, oh, yeah, I sort of know what that means. But you don't remember any of any of the stuff because you're just throwing so much stuff. And you're like, oh, what's applicable? What's not? You'll discover that so probably years into your career, and you're like, oh, yeah, I probably didn't need that. So if I had the ability, and the not the no responsibilities portion of it, I would totally go back and get my degree again, or get a masters and CS with like a specialty, because I would appreciate it more. And I'd be able to apply all that thing, all the things I've learned.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, maybe feel a little better about my decision in gym. Also, I think of like a benefit that I always thought about too, is, you know, being in school, like you're paying all this money to be there. And you look on the other side is like, yeah, it could be getting paid to learn, right? Like it as long as you have some of the like basics that you need is like you can learn on the job too, right? And like that applied learning is so critical. Like, I feel like that that to me helped me and yeah, I got paid a lot sooner than I would have if I took a full degree. So that was always one benefit that I play out my head. But who knows, maybe I could it could be that that investment could have paid off more for me, I could be making more money, right? Like you just don't know, it's

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
a really interesting point of like, Where would we be now if we didn't study what we did or like, didn't go to university for what we did. But I guess this is again, like kind of hinting at the benefits of I really appreciated the four years I had in university because I think going in as like as an 18 year old, I don't think I would know what I want to do with my life. I still don't know what I want to do with my life. And I think that like those four years really gave me the freedom to like, explore different things. And it really is, I think the privilege that that privilege of being of having that freedom to explore what it is I'm interested in or more importantly, what it is that I'm not interested in because I did a lot of different internships before I got to software like I because I was in business school. I like didn't work any internship and accounting internships in like investment banking internships, and I was like, Oh, nope, nope, nope, nope. And that's how I kind of like, when they started taking CS classes, I was like, Oh, this makes sense. And I think that that kind of like secured its path actually made me much more grateful and like, much more excited for what I do now. Because I've gone through and figured out some of the things I'm just not interested in. And it's kind of like that. Because you've experienced the negatives, you appreciate the positive, so much more. And I think that even when, you know, even as I joke around about, like how much I didn't like the degree I got, and I think that it's still so useful. And I think because for example, we talk a lot on this podcast about kind of like the the soft skills of software engineering of like communication, and like that team, like teamwork, and my business degree definitely helped me with that. And then when I went freelance and went independent, my business degree super helped me with that it taught me that I do not want to mess with my taxes. And I went and got an accountant right away. And it taught me like, you know, personal branding and give me like strategy. So I think that that not having a traditional background. I think it really comes back to that diversity conversation we have oh, background. Yes.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Cheers. Cheers.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I think it really is that diversity, a conversation of just having more perspectives or different perspectives because of that path we've taken. I will

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
say like, I was even homeschooled as a kid. So I have multiple non traditional, like, traditional there. Yeah, and I definitely and now opinion of like education is great. And the traditional structures are, you know, a sure there are bad versions of those, but usually they're they're incredibly helpful in there. Good. And to some extent, like the the paths you take to get there, you know, life happens and things you didn't plan for, and all that. But also there's elements of luck and privilege that feed into it were sort of having an untraditional background and ending like, like, I feel this all the time of like, I get to work at Netflix now. And that that feels to me, like one of those came up against the odds kind of stories, you know, like, there's there's many ways in which mean not having a guided education or, you know, looking essentially into a job in college that paid me to learn on the job. You know, without some of those factors, I definitely wouldn't be here. And so there's, like, I always definitely, you know, it's it's not just that, that, that I'm brilliant, and I didn't need school or anything like that, it's that I have these, these definitely cases of like fortune that set me up to, to, you know, take another step towards eventually ending

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
up here. Yeah, also, like Tuesday, we're talking on a podcast about this coming up, I'm trying to think of a different word for background. But yeah, I've been different, different backgrounds, tears is actually really beneficial to, we all have these things that we've learned to get there. And so you're coming at it to this, you know, working on a team, and you're bringing something different to the table, you're all you know, in our cases, all engineers and you know, we think about problems differently, but even more so on just the problems are doing is like just coming at it from different walks of life, it could be where you've grown up or you know, whatever it is even how you've learned it can just change your perspective on things. I think that's really healthy when especially in like we're building products that people are using, and just being able to think about those things is very beneficial.

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
One of the best engineers I ever interviewed for another position, had been a elite pastry chef for a while. And that's amazing. I love it that I heard like how that translated into an analytic mind and, and working with people and complex and everything like that. It was, it was, you know, she was also an excellent engineer. But that background just made it so much more gave her so much more insight that you wouldn't necessarily get if you didn't have someone with that, you know, quote, weird background?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, is it because she also brought in pastries that

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
she took a position with another company, so I never got to experience.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Terrible. I agree. I like the points, surely you're you're I think you're alluding to the diversity of thought, when you're building a strong team. Like literally, there are dozens of studies out there that show the strongest, most cohesive teams are ones that are made up with a variety of people from a variety of backgrounds, that preferably don't all look the same and act the same. It's the old, what's the saying, if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And that's true with problem solving, too. Like if everybody went to MIT, and they all graduated with honors, and they all are the same age and the same background and ethnicity and cultural background, then they're all going to solve problems the same way. And that, obviously, especially in software engineering, there are multiple ways to solve a problem and multiple approaches, if everybody had the same exact path to get to where we are, we would have the same linear view of software. And that is not it at all. Because software is largely a creative process, and not just the science. And that's missed a lot of times when we we think about like creating a team and traditional backgrounds and all that. So I should mention, I do have a slightly non traditional background in that. I graduated high school, and you just want to join in. So I graduated high school, you know, I went to college to start getting my CS degree, I failed out in a year and a half, because like I just wasn't ready. I didn't take it seriously, it just like was not for me at the time. I spent seven years working in a restaurant in Florida. And then I spent the rest of my time working at theme park as I got my degree. So like I went from community college, so I failed out with Community College and back to real university or big university, I would say I would not be the person I was today, if not for that time working in a restaurant. Because when I started, I was quiet and reserved and shy. And you know, I just like yes, sure I'll do anything and help you out. You're working. You learn in a restaurant pretty quickly. People take advantage of you if you're that person. So I think during those years I gained my voice. And now in meetings as Brian will attest to I'm the first person with opinion and a voice and I know how to articulate those things because I had to learn that and I would not be where I am today if not for I guess that divergent path that I took earlier as well.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And skills like that, Jem. They're not really ones that can be I maybe I'm wrong, but I don't feel like they can just be taught like sitting in a classroom. I'm sure someone could argue that you are learning some of those things presenting and in different ways in class, but I think some of those things, you're just like in that restaurant scenario. You, you had to learn that or you didn't survive, basically,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
yeah, I do believe strongly like, hopefully, if you're in a good position in life, but you should never regret the road you take to get to where you are. Because that, I think by denying that regretting that you deny part of yourself, and you're saying, like, there's a part of me that I don't like. And then that's, that's fine. There's parts we want to improve, but like, we should all love ourselves and not look back with regret. And if you do look back with regret, like, what did you learn? And what would you do differently in the future? I know, that's like, super NorCal, super positive hippie dippie. But like, I really believe that, like, people say, Oh, I regret not doing this, or I regret not getting my CS degree. But you are where you are, regardless of the road you took. So you did something right. And you made some right decisions. And that's what you should focus on.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And you can change it to like, you know, going back to David making that hard decision of like, that is a hard thing to do. But things can be changed. And I think it's I love actually what you said, Jeff, and then I like the positivity on that. But it took me a while to maybe come to that understanding that it's, it's like, why, why am I worried about that? Or why is that imposter syndrome eating away at me and like, it takes time, it's not easy to just get over that. But it's true. It's like, Wait, it's not the end of the world. Or if I really felt so inclined that I need a CS degree. What's stopping me, I mean, there's many things that are stopping me like time and things like that. But like the it could be something that if I cared that much, I could go do it, there's even courses or material online that will give you those Cs fundamentals, it's not like you have to go get the degree to do that.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Oh, speaking of those course, materials, I actually wanted to add that there's also like a community benefit, too. And maybe this is a bias this is, you know, this is definitely not tested, this is just like my, my sample sizes. Just disclaimer, but I find that a lot of the speakers that I meet are oftentimes from non traditional backgrounds, cheers. Oftentimes self taught, I feel like a lot of the teachers on different platforms are often like self taught, and I feel like that. And my theory is for that is that like, one to change your career, like shift your whole career around, I think it takes a certain amount of initiative and introspection to say, like, oh, I don't quite, I'm not quite enjoying where I am. And there's like this other opportunity that I think might suit me much better. Like, that's the I think that's like a certain amount of self awareness, that self awareness and initiative that probably also prompts people to go out there and give those talks or, you know, teach those workshops. And I think that added on to the fact that like, when when someone is self taught, they like, knew the pain of like, you know, not being able to connect the dots, not knowing what they don't know. And I think that those are the people that teach the best because they like, there's like the battle scars there to be like, you know, it wasn't just that they got to kind of like, sit and be lectured to was like they had to go out and find all of those resources. And they, I feel like, my theory is that they are really, really great teachers not trying to shade anybody with a traditional background. That's like, you know, giving talks and, and giving workshops and courses. But I do feel like there, there is a not yet proven by me, but correlation there. And I think that that is a such a great community benefit.

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
Yeah, we're kind of in a rare industry, where everyone is so excited to, to teach everybody else. Many other fields in which you can kind of just waltz in and everyone's like, hey, what do you want to know? And it was short, shortly thereafter, you are also now skilled and can do it yourself and can turn around and teach other people and, you know, make a living off of that. That's, that seems like yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
it's pretty cool. Like, we share information, we don't hold on to it and be like, I've learned this skill set, I'm going to charge you a fortune for me to just do this. It's like, let's share the wealth of knowledge. Before we jump into pics, I'm curious to what advice would you all give someone like I even think the you know, David going back in time and being in that case, where I'm like, Am I doing the right thing? I want to take this drastic shift. But like really someone coming at it from wanting to maybe really early on trying to make that decision or just like moving into software engineering that may not come from the CS background. What's cheers. What advice do you give them today?

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
I would echo what Shirley said about the habits of introspection. If you're bothered by what you're doing right now or if something doesn't sit right or you feel like you want to do something else, then you know, and let's say you've you've preliminary, you're you've tentatively identified that, that software engineering is that other thing you want to do. Do a little more work on like what bothers you right now and when Which of those things can you change? And will become a software engineer change those things? If the answer is yes, great, then keep going. I think another thing as well is, is building something we mentioned the the reading and tutorial tutorial versus building. I think one thing that's worked for me really well is if you try to look at, like, there's the the front end Engineering Handbook, something that's updated every year, there's an amazing flowchart in that, that shows just everything you need to know as a front end engineer having the different huge branches, all of which have their own huge subject areas. And if you look at that, and go like, Oh, no, I have to learn that, like, you might not get started. So instead of that, you know, wherever you're at, you've learned some, you know, for me early on, like, I love CSS, and then I knew a little bit of jQuery. And so I started building that and take, like, the the thing you know, or the thing you're learning, but also hook it to a specific idea. So just like, oh, no, I wrote, you know, this kind of code. Okay, well, there, I did the tutorial lesson, you know, that's fine. If you have an idea, whether it's your own idea, or trying to copy something else, you know, like in InDesign, a lot of people will do the, okay, I'm going to redesign the Craigslist homepage, I'm going to read Facebook, that can be a really good exercise of take a specific idea. And then use a specific piece of tech you're trying to learn, and use that specific kind of tech to build your specific little idea. And that is a great way to then get into the weird corners of the of the tech you're trying to learn or of the design you're trying to produce. And when you come out of that you'll have built something that might be good might not, but you will, you will have discovered either like, this particular framework that I was trying is great, and I'm going to build more stuff with it. Or you might realize, actually, you know, I'm at the level already, where I realized this isn't the right tool, or isn't the tool I like to use. So I'm going to go try something else next time. I think that's really a helpful pattern, if you're trying to, like skill yourself up, if you're trying if you know, this is what you want to do, and you want to learn more. Try try to get a little more specific, as you learn and you'll you'll find that you you'll probably gain better knowledge and more applicable knowledge than if you try to absorb just the huge spectrum of fun and knowledge all at once.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think another thing I was thinking about too is if you're thinking about it in those early stages, and you're you're not quite sure reaching out to people because like, as we said is like we're very happy to share and teach and not everyone's gonna respond. But like there's enough people that you can go and try and hit up and just say like, I would love to hear more about your role and like what you do, people are usually very open to that. And it's scary. Don't Don't get me wrong. It's like you're worried like, Oh, I got to reach out to this person. But what's the worst can happen? They don't respond? Or they say no, that's it. But like, you could get some time with them and just ask them in 2030 minutes, you can learn a lot about is this right for me? And what's this person's job. And I think like too often people don't do that. I think that that's a really helpful tool.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I'm gonna add a caveat of do your homework, first of like, you know, like, get get all of the basic questions answered by like the myriad of different resources out there. And then when you're choosing a person, choose them because you have very specific questions for them. Not not just like, how do I get it? How do I start coding like that, I think is a way to annoy someone. Good point.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, thank you for adding that piece of advice early. That's,

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
of course, I get I get this, I get this a lot. So that's,

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
I think the phrase, can I pick your brain just do doop, doop, doop, doop, just delete that right there and

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
specific, like, what are you wanting to know?

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Yeah, I also wanted to add, I'm just thinking about back to my, like, 21 year old self like that was felt like, it was the end of the world if I couldn't successfully get into software, like get a software job. And you know, with my business background or something, I just want to say like, especially when we're young, I think that, um, I think when I was in college, I just thought that the first thing that I did after college was what I was going to keep doing for like, you know, 45 years until retirement or something like that, where it just felt like, I don't know, I feel like we, as a society, we kind of like we overemphasize the like, you go to college, and you learn something, and that's what you need to, to like spend your life doing. I mean, this is something that you know, David, you like touched on, it feels like there's such a big risk, and I think there is a big risk, but at the same time, especially when we're a bit younger. I don't think it's a bad thing to try something, whether that's software or something else for a few years and see if it works. works out or not. And if it works out, that's great. And if it doesn't, then you just try something and you like, add that skill set and add that tool to your background. And you just that just makes you so much more interesting as a person. And as a job candidate, later down the line. And, and I say that with like, kind of an asterisk of like, I think that's if you are in the fortunate situation where you don't have to worry too much about finances. And like, you know, if you do the career switch, like you're not like, it's not detrimental to your, like personal finance. If it is, then please ignore this advice.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Well, I think that's it too is like this is coming from privilege of like, yeah, if you can afford to do that, and yes, here's how that's a valid point.

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
Yeah. When I, when I made the switch, by the way, it was, it was hard. I didn't have the, I wasn't so young that I'd like at that time, like I had bought a house. And I was and, like had these other sort of, you know, the, the, like, the bills and the responsibilities that I couldn't just like sell everything. And, you know, set up without it. So, for instance, one point where I was working for a small company, back in Minnesota where I lived, and I just was getting antsy, and I wanted to have my own name on some things and have changed of scenery and different projects. And, and so I wanted to set out on my own, but like I said, I had these bills and responsibilities, so I couldn't just quit and see him. So I started, yes to every freelance job that came along and started aiming for bigger ones. So I had a long stretch of not much sleep, which I don't recommend, because I did that I was able to do that for a year and a half solid. And then I burned out hard, but that's another episode. But I said yes, everything that came along. And finally, there was one job that was about three months of work. You know, that was runway, essentially. And I not only would it let me jump to being freelance, but also I couldn't take it on if I didn't quit my day job. And that was the point at finally where I said, Okay, this is it. And let me make that particular shift. At the time I switched careers altogether. No, I had as well like the support I needed around me where I guess maybe this portion, I just wasn't making that much money anyway, and the thing I was doing originally, so it makes

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
it easy.

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
But definitely I had I had support, I had a safety net around me that was that was able to do that. And I even had some classmates from chiropractor school who ended up with the same decision and decided who want to make that change. And couldn't by the time they were there because, you know, they they hadn't started with web designing College, and now they had a family and consider supporting The on the other factors that didn't let him do that. So I always acknowledge that as well as making that switch is a risk there, sort of modulate that risk, but definitely for for your case, maybe it's just too much risk. And that happens. I'm lucky again that that somehow I was able to get around that risk,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
right? Well, I set a great spot to jump into picks in each episode of the front end happier podcasts. We love to share things that we've found interesting, and hopefully you do too. Jem, you want to start it off.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
For my pick, I only have one because I've had a busy month and I just haven't been doing much creative things. But of course my one pick is a good one. For my valley silicon pick. That's the part of the show where I pick things that are too ridiculous and too expensive. And they only exist because well we get paid way too much money here in Silicon Valley. You know, this pic actually isn't too bad because it solves a real problem that I have. Because you know you get out. You go to a restaurant now you pick up the food, and you got to take it home. And specifically I'm talking about burritos which I love. I love burritos, tacos, all any sort of Mexican food I am all over it. Love it all. But you know the burritos sometimes too hot and it's too messy and it just doesn't work. But this pic here is a burrito pop twistable burrito holder. Yes. You didn't even know that you needed this until I shared it with you. So you're welcome front and half of our regulars. For the low price of $33. You can get a plastic burrito holder that you can twist and it slowly pushes up the burrito much like a toothpaste tube or I don't know giving a better analogy. That's really

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
this is the low low early bird price. dollars, because apparently the retail price is $50.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
But this solves a real problem, like the real problem of how do I keep my burrito warm and how do I eat it without getting everywhere? And for $33 you can solve that problem. You know, tin foil doesn't work for you. No, no, it's still good because you still have to unwrap the burrito and it's still messy. So you know this this is a real problem right?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
What's really funny is I have seen this like I don't remember when but I have not like physical but I've seen the this page before and I remember thinking it was ridiculous, then I'm still gonna stand by. It gets ridiculous. Now of

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
course, also say that in the videos and adjusts, it still looks like you have to unwrap your own tinfoil it looks like you have to,

because you're because you're still getting the burrito in the tin foil. So to that point, you're still taking it like I went and bought the burrito that came in the tin foil. I'd have to unwrap it, throw it in this container. So yeah, you're correct.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
But now your portable burrito holder, but you're gonna wrap it all the way. Put it in the Brita holder and then you have no problem. You have to clean out the burrito holder afterwards.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You're not going to look ridiculous carrying this container.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Oh my people, people will think you're walking through the park eating burrito be like the thermos. Yeah, that's a thought leader out there. That person's ahead of the curve. I bet the burrito is nice and warm. That's filling in anywhere. There's any beans or anything it spills out. It's in the bottom of burrito. You dump that out. You eat those at the end. You know, it's it's all around brilliance. I'm jealous. I didn't think of this.

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
Oh, that's stupid between like, that's actually pretty awesome.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
No, I do not encourage.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
All the things I pick are usually ridiculous.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
The real tragedy is if you're eating and the beans still fall out. That'd be the real tragedy.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
That's when you need to buy the burrito net. So it goes around the burrito. That's that's not a real thing. multiple sizes

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
that match the size of the burrito you're about to have.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Ooh, that's for you, too. Yeah. So that's my pick. I forget who shared with me with me. I think it was on Twitter. If you tagged valid hashtag Valley silicon on Twitter, I will see it because I pretty much the only one that use that hashtag, which is kind of weird. In this world of a billion people that a million tweets, that's still the only use of that hashtag. So go and tag everything and send it to me because I get a good laugh out of them.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right, surely What do you have

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I come on this podcast just for gems Valley silicon. And my first pick is if you are already here, and working front end. And if you want to go into even more of a niche of data visualization, we welcome you. And I have two picks here. And the it's both from my co author, Nadia Bremmer, um, she has a website called Visual cinnamon calm. And she has two really great blog posts one from 2017, about her journey into data visualization, where she kind of like shows because she does like beautiful, beautiful work, beautiful data visualization work. But she in this blog post kind of like she she shows you what she calls her like ugly ducklings of like, all of the iterations that she went through all of the projects that she never published and, and basically her like, you know, how she got to where she is now. And then she has another one a second one from 2020 called learning data visualization, which is kind of like about her path into data visualization, all of the different resources that she used to get into data visualization. So you know, on this episode about non traditional backgrounds, Oh, cheers, getting into something new. Um, if you are ever interested in data visualization, I highly recommend those two blog posts. And then I have another one, and is a YouTube channel called cinema therapy. And I and my husband, I have been like really enjoying this YouTube channel. He is essentially two hosts, one is a licensed therapist, and the other one um, he calls himself an unlicensed filmmaker. And every single episode, what they do is they break down a, you know, a movie from a, they choose like a like a theme, usually around like relationships or something psychology related, and then they'll talk about that from the therapy perspective. And then they'll also kind of talk about like, how the filmmaking emphasizes this. It's a very, very interesting YouTube channel. We've been like watching it for a few months, and honestly, it's kind of been like a free couples therapy, so highly recommend.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Alright, David, what do you have?

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
I have a because of this, I have four picks today. Nice. I've never heard you mentioned a limit on pick. So I feel like I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
don't think we've ever I don't know what the most is. But yeah, we don't really have a limit. So you're good to go.

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
I have four varieties of picks. So I have a music pick. This is by Peter Gregson. GRE je S O N It's Bach Chelsea sweets recomposed. So it's this happens to be great coding music. It's just beautiful as well originally heard one of the pieces on the soundtrack to the HBO series The Young Pope. It is like Bach Cello suites are great. This takes him in in new and weird direction, sometimes dramatically different and sometimes subtly different. But it's a beautiful album to listen to, and I just can't recommend it enough. The second one is a cocktail related pick which is seemed appropriate here, the aviary cocktail book. So the aviary is this bar in Chicago that was started by the same crew who runs Alinea, the restaurant. It's, it's an incredible book, you need to buy equipment to make most of the drinks in there. So it's an undertaking, but it's, it's a gorgeous book by itself. And everything in there, I'm sure is delicious. There's also a companion to it called zero, which is all non alcoholic cocktails, but they're not just juice. They're also amazing and all the ways that the regular cocktails are so I can't recommend this highly enough. My wife and I have a plan of making one thing from one of these books each month because there's there's gonna be like work that goes into it. But the results are incredible. The third thing is Matt Levine's money stuff newsletter. He's a writer at Bloomberg. I'm by no means like I financial, financially knowledgeable person, but his writing is so funny and informative at the same time. If you could have someone who wrote like him in any subject, you'd probably enjoy it learn a lot from him. And and his newsletter is like one of the few newsletters I actually subscribe to much less financial newsletters. The last one is Rue shells cheesecakes. So this one is is a small business run by a friend of mine and Victor Harris is an Oakland is by far the best cheesecake ever had. You can get it delivered anywhere in the in the Bay Area. He's He's amazing as cheesecake is just stellar.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
As a resident of the town, I will check this out because I am a cheesecake critic. These look delicious. And a plus one that I have such a huge fan of Matt Levine and his writing is brilliant. His his ability to break down like arcane topics of finance into digestible and entertaining bits is like the work of genius. Like I know it's weird to nerd out about like finance stuff, but he breaks it down and makes it so approachable. It's definitely worth reading.

</p>
<p><strong>David Simmer</strong><br />
He's got a recurring theme of like, maybe absolutely everything is securities fraud, everything

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
securities violations, everything is fraud. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right. And I have to pick I have had one that I was reading a blog post the other day on, I've noticed like GitHub does their automatic, like if you create a new repo, now your default branches mean, which is great, but it doesn't change all your pre existing repositories. So I found a great blog post, it was super simple to go back and change all your branches from master to mean and I felt like that was a really easy read. So I'll throw that in the show notes. And then I figured I would share a newsletter interview that I did called dads in tech, I was interviewed about like being a dad and like the questions are really good and related to like tech things. And it was a fun little interview I did so I'll link to that as well. I think it was just released in like mid February. So I'll share that well before we end the episode.
