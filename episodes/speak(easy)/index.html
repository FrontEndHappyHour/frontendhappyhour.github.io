<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Welcome to a brand new episode of Front End happy hour. If you've been enjoying the podcast, we'd love to hear from you leave us a review on iTunes. It helps others discover the podcast and we read all the reviews. We would love to hear your thoughts and feedback. This is episode 47. And we'll be talking about our experiences giving tech talks and public speaking. Let's go around the table and give brief introductions of today's panelists. Augustus you want to start it off.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, sure. Hi, my name is Augustus. I'm a front end engineer at Evernote. Jem Young

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Senior Software Engineer at Netflix,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Stacy London front end engineer at Atlassian

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Mars Jullian's Senior Software Engineer at Netflix,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
as they aim for something creative Mars. No, I

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
was about to say senior ish software engineer at Netflix.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix. In each episode of the front end happier podcast we'd like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all, in the podcast, we will all take a drink. What did we decide today's keyword is conference conference. So if we say the word conference at all, and the rest of the podcasts, we will all take a drink. To start off with what is it like to give your first tech conference talk? Cheers,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
cheers.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
We're gonna work that I purposely

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
did that. It's terrifying. That's

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
not even a conference talk. But here's even just just a tech talk at you know, in front of even 20 people, your first one in front of like a larger engineering organization is terrifying.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I would have said nerve racking. So yeah, I don't think it gets less scary. I think I still struggle with that. But I I feel like I'm less nervous in a larger audience than I am. Sometimes even with my own peers, I think is difficult doing run throughs I feel sometimes even more nerve racking. I don't know why probably because I feel like you're judging me.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Is there a sweet spot of audience size? I wonder because sometimes having a smaller audience of five to 10 people can be just as nerve racking as it being hundreds of people, but maybe somewhere in the middle. It's you

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
always feel like after 100 I don't notice a difference. I don't know. Jem, you just spoke in Brazil or Brazil js that was a huge audience.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
What 2000?

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yes.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Do you feel like it was any difference from speaking out? Like one or 200?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah, it was it's very different.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Alright, so I'm just like underselling it. I think I've done is like 500.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I think the bigger it is, the easier it is. Because you don't have to look at individual people anymore.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I guess that's what I was trying to get it.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah, I agree with Mars, it's much harder to talk to a smaller group, and especially people, you know, yeah, is much, much harder.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
They're judging you, they're gonna give you feedback.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Judgment, and

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
you you respect them. So you want them to respect you back just as much. So that's where I think some of the pressure comes from.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. I like that better.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Oh, that's a good maybe it's like imposter syndrome bubbling up. Everybody thinks you're smart. But now you have to prove it in front of people that actually matter.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think in in addition to being actually intelligent, and having good content for your talk is also there's the delivery aspect, too. So there's, there's two things going on, not only do you have to be technically astute, but you also need to be able to deliver and handle feedback. So there's like an additional layer on top of that, I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
think what makes a good tech talk,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
everyone has their own personal opinion about that. Yeah, I think everyone brings a different perspective to like, why they're attending a conference cheers. Like some, some people, you know, want to level up, some people don't even know anything about the topic. So I don't know, for me, the most interesting talks that I've gone to are the ones that are not something that I could have read a blog post about, or I could have done like some searching on on the internet and found like, how to do something, it's more like, here's a problem that we ran into, at my current, like a real world problem that we ran into using some some stack technology. And here's how we solved it, and some best practices around it. And here's some sample code that like shows how we did this thing. And it's not something that you easily find, which I know that makes, like doing a talk probably more difficult because you self doubt that the fact that you the thing that you solved is actually like unique. But I think that's more true than not true. So that's the kind of talk that I really enjoy that I can come away from, like, practical, from the trenches kind of stuff.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Well, I think everyone's gonna deal with a unique problem, right? Even if it's similar, it's unique because it was done a little bit differently for your own use cases at your own company or your own work. So yeah, I that makes a lot of sense.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Bad example, or example of what makes a bad tic toc is people that are too engrossed in their own problem. And they don't speak to the audience like they don't know their audience and that's one of the more common ones I see people who Just start talking. They're like, here's some problems. I'm Stacy, I'm gonna talk about some obscure bug that I solved that only has relevance to me and my team. And everybody's like, okay, cool. What? What's the point of this? Why am I here? I see that like, that's very common amongst Tech Talk.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Is it there that they're just not explaining enough what the problem was? Or is just irrelevant? The problem just isn't relevant to anyone, and they're never going to deal with it? Or what do you think it is more just the delivery or just bad topic in general?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I think it's hubris, just like, you think what you're talking about is so interesting that everybody else will find interesting because you spent six months on it. Because that as engineers, that's what we do. We have this like, giant problem our head, and then we try to explain it to people. And it just, it makes no sense. We've been thinking about it for months and months and months. And then you got to give a talk on that it just doesn't translate because you can't pull back and be like, Okay, why is this important? Can I break it down in the concrete steps rather than, here's, here's why it's so important, because I've spent so much time thinking about it. And obviously, you must think that too,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
there's definitely a really big skill in taking, like, a very central, like, taught like very, how to play like a top like a problem with a lot of jargon and stuff, breaking that down and making it like kind of comprehensible to, I guess layman terms, if you will. But like, I really respect those kind of tech talks, because there are some talks there just probably normally would be over your head. But then like, people do a really good job of breaking it down and making it very, like understandable and relatable as you

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
wait. To be honest, I don't really like tech talks that go really, really depth in the weeds on on, I don't know what it is, I feel. It's not that they've lost me, but maybe they have because I feel like when I'm at a conference, cheers. I'm listening to multiple talks. And I like something that's inspirational and tells me a great story. And I can follow along really easily. And it's not something that I have to pay attention to, like 110% is those things are exhausting. I don't know what it is, I don't know what the right balance is. I also don't want a talk that doesn't go into some tech. But I also want something inspirational. And maybe it is just a really good story about some problem that is being solved and how someone solved it. staying a little higher level is usually better in my mind, but I've heard the opposite from others.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
No, I totally agree. I, I personally feel I don't like it when people like code all the time. Unless it's like thought out. I've seen a lot of bad like, typing, and you don't

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
want to see people code on.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
It's just like, well, you know, I mean, like, it's Yeah, although is exciting when they debug their own code, figure it out. But I actually like

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
when the audience debugs that kind

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
of a typo. Right. I think there's

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
a happy medium between like explaining what you're trying to talk about enough detail that people will understand it and respect what you're working on. But also you need to just pique their interest sometimes, too. And, and when it goes into the more technical details, it's kind of just a matter of, okay, if you're really interested in this, like, here's the rest of the code, and we can talk about it later. But I think that 40 minutes or even 20 minutes is not a good medium for like, Oh, here's how I re architected a whole something, something, you don't have time to go into that. No,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
there's not enough because really, if you think about the last time you re architected something, it didn't take 20 to 40 minutes to figure out I

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
would say how do you condense eight months of work into a 40 minute talk and try to hit all of the points that you really want to? So

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
that's that's advice I wish I would have had when I first started speaking, I don't see that all the these are popular tips or helping you to be a better public speaker. I feel number one should be know your audience, like know who you're talking to that way, you know if you can go high level, low level. Yeah. The most difficult talk I've given to date, I think was at South by Southwest because that was an audience full of people that they see a Netflix name. They're like, Oh, I love Netflix. I'm gonna go not engineers whatsoever. And there's people that are like, Oh, Netflix, Jem Young, I know him. Let's get like he's going to talk about something super detail and trying to hit all those points for everybody is, yeah, it's very hard, if not impossible, but it's important now like, Who do you care takes away something from you're talking about them today? Is it people that are fresh in the industry, never use React or JavaScript or anything? Are the people that super technical that you're going to lose everybody else, you'll get three people in the audience. I think hitting that is one of the biggest challenges that speaker that people don't think about when they start writing a talk.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Do you think it's useful to set up front this talk is for someone who doesn't know react or this is someone who's really strong at React and we're gonna go really in depth? Yeah, I

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
think so. Put that in your like, write up or your little blurb that whatever it gets published for, like, the agenda for the conference, cheers. That someone can scan it and read and be like, Oh, this one's pretty advanced or whatever they can self select. That's

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
interesting, too, to talk about knowing your audience because it's a way to like breathe new life into a conference talk. It's a it's a way to To take a lot of effort that you've put into one talk and be able to I'm not travel around with it, but kind of repackage it and have it be relevant to different audiences is content, the content may always be the same, but the way you deliver it, or the how high level you go with, the concept is going to probably change a little bit from, you know, event to event or from one meetup to another. And I think that's just, it's a really good way for some of the content to live a really long time. lessons you learn from something you worked on two years ago may still be relevant today. It's just a way of packaging it for your audience. Important. Remember,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
for everybody who's given a talk or three or something, once you get some experience on your belt, there's always gonna be someone that's like, I knew all this stuff already. I didn't want anything new. He's have to ignore those people, unfortunately, because you just can't get everybody. No, I tried to get like, 80% of the audience at this. And if you have more detailed questions, come ask me later. But hey, you know, I at least make an entertaining. But yeah, trying to make it too technical to impress people is a mistake. I think I made the beginning. Just like way, way, way too deep, and then no one cared. Like halfway through my talk,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think my goal is for, and this isn't for everyone in the audience. But my goal is first, maybe it is 80% of everyone to just take away something. And it might be very, very small that it wasn't that important, because maybe, maybe it is like generalist talk but they're they pick something out of there that they can walk away with. And it could just be very, very small. But to me, that's a win is just like getting someone to think a little bit differently or take away one little small piece with it.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Yeah, actually, that was one of the best pieces what I don't know if I would call it advice necessarily that I got from not not Ryan. But it's really along the same lines of like, people walk away from talks or conferences.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
It's subtle.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Normally only walk away from from stuff like that with maybe one or two points. And I think someone said that explicitly to me. But in my experience, too, you walk away from from a meetup, and you're like, Oh, I learned one or two things, not everything. And that kind of took the pressure off. For me as a speaker saying, you know, this doesn't need to be the most amazing talk ever. Not every single slide needs to be like tweet worthy, or someone's gonna learn something new. Every word I say, it takes the pressure off a little bit. And you can kind of play with your talk a bit more. And then that way, because you can like, well, people are going to take away from it, what they're going to take away from it. And someone's going to take away something from the beginning. And someone's going to take away something from the end. And it's it's nice to think about it that way in my mind, just because it's a little less stressful. still important, but just one.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So that being said, to everybody in the room, what's the most important part of the talk? Do you think you think it's the intro? Even it's the ending? You think it's like the main content?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think it's the intro. I really do. If you lose people right at the start listening to the rest if you don't excite them at all. You've lost everyone in the room. They're all on Twitter. They're all on their laptop doesn't really matter.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
For a funny intro. Huge. Yeah, like some sort of humor or personal story, some sort of story, something that's like, not super dry tech, stuff like that. But it also has

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
to relate. Yeah, it

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
has Brando's

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I actually, it's kind of it's harder, but I think the delivery is the most important because I think you need to be excited and passionate about what you're talking about that people want to listen to you throughout the talk because the intro is one thing but five minutes in, they can be like, Okay, now I'm done. And then you go back to their laptops. But if you have kind of like sprinkles of humor with that throughout it or self deprecation or something that just you know, grabs people's attention as it starts to kind of like wander away. I think that's pretty important and delivery, that tonality and the excitement and the passion that comes through.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I agree counter counterpoint. I think humor can be it's hard to actually do humor well because every sense of humor is a little different. Saying like all my talks, I tried to make humor so like I have no other delivery method but I should but I would I would love the ability to give like an Obama style. Like talk where it's just like impressive. It's not funny but it's just impressive and I think doing that is really really difficult humor is I think the easiest way but giving just like a monotone or just even just solid delivery with no humor is really really hard to

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
do. No I think yeah, it's the delivery and tech talks a lot of the time you see it come through with humor or Jeff's because that's just the community that we live in work and so you know, Jem's got a masterful use of the dog Jeff's

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
i don't know I'm like very anti give Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
he tries to avoid it. Nevermind.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I remember you're talking about Fast and Furious and you're like I like that.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
But I guess the second that delivery thing I think like showing personality, you know, it's I think it can be I don't know, it's it's really cool to see different speakers talk because they all have different approaches and different like ways of doing like how they deliver their own tech talks. So I feel like that's what really stands out. I remember watching your talk and the Fast and Furious thing like really stuck out is like a really sticks out.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It was a good way like to just hook everyone in. So now you're known for the Fast and the Furious. Darn it.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Was that the service workers talk?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
It's probably been all my talks

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I saw in the trend. pilars talk. Ah, yeah, a couple talks, then

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
a lot of talks, just mix it up. So I think Need for Speed is actually better and faster. I will make a strong argument

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
you can have that debate with yourself in your next time.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
How do you each go about choosing a topic? I think this is really, it can be really difficult actually is really understanding what what do you actually want to talk about if you are submitting to a proposal

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
is I'm only done to talk. So I don't have like a ton of experience, like official conferences. Or what you did there? You tried to avoid tried? Just nothing? I Yeah. My wine. And so for me, I wanted to submit something that I wish, I wish that I could have found what I was going to present somewhere, and I didn't. And so that's what that's how I thought about it. Like, this topic is something that I think other people run into this problem. I see people submitting questions on Stack Overflow sees people talking about in Slack groups, there's a good answer for it all pays off. I'll present my answer, or like how we got to an answer as a team. And that's kind of how I thought about it.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
For context. I think I'm the only one that hasn't given. I didn't get seen you give talks. I've given internal talk. So yeah, that's why it's still a tech talk. Yeah, that's true. But I guess my take on what topic you should choose is something you are really like passionate about and something you feel pretty confident in giving a talk about. The thing I think that scares me most is q&a is when people like start asking questions. That's why it's kind of like, oh, wow, you, you know so much. Let me give you questions. And that's I don't know, I don't I don't know if I could just give any tech talk. That's just,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
yeah, on the q&a subject. How do you each feel about that? I for one, don't really like the q&a, if I have to have it. That's requirement. Yeah, sure. I'll go up on stage and answer questions. But typically, I've found they've not been the greatest questions. It's sometimes I've often seen this many, many times where someone will ask a question that they want you to pretty much solve their problem for their company stack. And it takes a lot to really understand what they're asking. And so that's not really fair to the rest of the audience. I'm happy to go talk offline, like on the side of the, you know, room afterwards, or whatever it is over drinks, but it's really tough to solve that on stage with a large group of people.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I agree. I don't like live q&a. I don't. If there's fundament, like, I know the counter argument is someone has a question that is relevant to the whole audience. Yeah. But I think if there's that question, then I didn't give a good talk like that should have been solved. During the feedback phase. Once one's like, Well, what about this? Like, Oh, good point. But yeah, if there's like something that they're dying to ask me, like, asked me offline, or just want to get done speaking, but generally, there's always the well, actually person, yes, well, actually, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, or some obscure thing. And it's just, it's so the benefit of no one and to the detriment of those people, the worst, fear the worst?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Blah, do you think about the cargo cult of yours? Like, I don't want are you even saying

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
no, I think yeah, the well, actually person always I think there's like different types of well, actually, but the one that really gets to me as a person who's trying to outsmart you, in front of the whole audience, at the very end of your talk is just to me, it's, you know, you know, well, actually, would you like to come up here and talk about that topic, because you're more than welcome to, and it's just,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I'd love to see that. Oh, if someone were to

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
ask that. We were response next time. My next talk,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I'd like to see like grabbing the podium and just flipping your turn. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
no, I just, it's meant to embarrass you. And for whatever reason, and it's just very, very frustrating. And I think it's also really, it's a deterrent for new for new speakers. It's a complete deterrent, and it's just not very welcoming and accepting. And it can be very, very stressful.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I actually am kind of curious when you guys have submitted talks to coughs

when you guys submitted talks, is there a required template? Like do they require q&a? Or is this is it all up to you to decide?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
No, some? Typically, they'll set that ahead of time is saying that there any mean I shouldn't even say ahead of time, it may just be the way the event is run. That that's being asked of you.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah. Cuz I guess like, it would be nice. I guess they did it conference.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
A good keyword. As opposed to saying the actual keyword. I know I had to do that too earlier,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
which really discouraging. Ah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I don't know. That's a good question. I mean, I'm not a fan. Like,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I'm sorry, I'm not a fan. It really does seem overly unnecessary. Yeah, I can't really recall like, when I've been to a QA it was like, wow, I really wish that guy asked that question. You know,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I can't I can't think of someone asking a question. And I was like worth it. That was worth

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
that, that thank you for interrupting Yeah, I wouldn't

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
go up and ask them myself

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
rather, I can see why they do do it, though, why the organizers would do something like that, because some attendees may expect to have some sort of a q&a and it is part it's kind of a common format. But it's also it can be unwelcoming to speakers. But it also is welcoming to attendees at the same time. So trying to find maybe it's just a way of finding a q&a format that works a bit better for both. And actually, I really liked what they did at Nordic js, which was, there was no q&a after any of the talks. But there was like a speaker's corner that you could go to afterwards. And there was a giant

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
blow up a glue.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
A Speaker's Corner gets a little weird, though, because I put the speakers in the globe with people asking questions like I don't want to go into with some stranger. Anyways. So I like, you know, take the ego out of the equation. I think that that was an interesting format or a must. Yeah, it was just, you know, after every couple of talks, because are kind of not expected. But you know, they're, they're going to be over in this corner. You can go talk to them

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
like that. Yeah, like office hours. That's a great. Yeah, I

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
think so. And also, you know, throughout the after parties, and all of the events after the talks to people would come up and like, oh, I recognize that you gave that talk. Oh, let's I have questions for you. And, and that's kind of a, you know, a more informal setting, it doesn't really put you on the spot. So I really liked that. But that the q&a was there, it was just in a slightly different format.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So I'm at large, multitrack. tech events. I don't mind q&a, if it's like very small and very focused on one particular topic. That's okay. I think single track officers like Q and A's, maybe that's wasting time. Yeah, you could fit another speaker in all that time. You

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
that's a good point. Yeah. Cuz usually when it's multitrack, people are getting up to go to like another Yeah, talk or something like that. So yeah, that's a good point. So back to my original question, how do you think about a topic that you want to talk about? What are some ways that you? How do you plan that

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think it actually is really collaborative, or at least in the way I've experienced it. Talks always look like it's one person delivering something, but there's a huge support system behind getting that talk from ideation to actual, you know, speaking, in, in me having an idea, or it's mostly about finding something I'm really passionate about, and then talking to someone about it. And you know, generally over drinks a little bit inspired a little bit tipsy, you know, that's when the connections in the brain start working. And then over time, you realize that there actually is some some substance or that other people will appreciate. But it does kind of take some teasing out by other people, because they also offer a different perspective than the way you see it. Because Oh, it's that important. I think about it every day. And this is kind of what Stacy said earlier about how do you take a project that you're always in the weeds in and figure out that it's interesting to someone else? And I think other people help to kind of tease out what's interesting about it, because like, oh, I want to hear more about that. And from there, it takes a while, I think from Oh, this is something I'm passionate about, too. Oh, this would be a good talk. It could be months, it could be half a year, I don't I don't know how other people have experienced it. But that's how I that's how I have.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
That's interesting, because you have such a awesome like team to support you in that stuff in people on your team that have spoke. So you have like, that kind of circle around you. But I know like I didn't have like in some of the places that I've worked, like, doing a conference talk was like, share, cheers. Talk was I don't know, it wasn't it wasn't like exciting for your coworkers. No one was there to help you or they weren't like, like, cool. That's awesome. Like, but not like actively wanting to help you make your talk better, that kind of thing. So I don't think that's, that's tough. Like if you don't have that support network of people you can bounce ideas off of. So you have to find other networks to do that. Maybe some other community or waited way to do that. Maybe your local meetup. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
we're here for you, Stacey. Thanks, man.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think it's yeah, if you can find someone to bounce ideas off of even we always talk about Twitter is a great way to just like reach out to people ask them, hey, does this sound like something that's interesting, that can be really helpful to you?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I found people just message me on Twitter and say, Hey, I've got an idea. And I want to flesh it out. And we just video chat for an hour or something. And like, usually, by the end, they have something a bit more concrete. But yeah, I think as tech community, it's always good to spread your idea and see what people think. Yeah, most people are pretty amenable to like

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
listening. I was like how you've chosen topics gem.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I just picked things that either I don't know what I'm interested in, or I really, really know. And I'm just like, this is the thing that's so passionate. I'm so passionate about it, and I want to spread that out. But it's a lot of ways don't tell the conference organizers. It's a lot of times I don't actually know that much about the topic, but I'm really interested in learning and talking Talk is probably the best way to learn something because you have to, you can't be during the q&a later in the hallway. So when I ask you a question and like blah, blah, you can't be like, Oh, I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
don't know, I just read a script. I have no idea. Yeah, I

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
just read a blog post. And, you know, you have to know, inside and out, it's a good reason. It's good excuse to learn something like a deep dive on it.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah. So that was interesting that you did that. Typically, how I've done is I find something I'm really passionate about. Maybe I'm not the expert in and that's okay. I'm gonna give you my perspective on the topic, but it's something I'm excited to talk about. But I never even thought about it is something until you've said that is pick something that you're excited about learning. So I'm excited about it, that I want to learn it. So I'm obviously probably going to be excited to talk about it. And it'll be a forcing factor to go learn it. I like that a

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
lot. Actually, caveat to that, I would not recommend doing that. If it's your first talk, or maybe even your second, it's something that you want to I'm a good speaker, I know how to deliver a topic. And then I can like learn something. But if it's your first time and you haven't given a talk, and you're learning about a new topic as well, I think it's a bit much like pick something you know. And then like from there later on, you could do you know, kind of the ad lib topic. So

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
it sounds like the way we've been talking. It's not the easiest thing to do talking at a conference. Cheers.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Keyword,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
but it's not typically easy. As you've been doing it, does it get any easier.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I feel like it does as you practice. I took some public speaking classes. For my final in college, we had to speak in front of the middle school during passing period, where everyone walks by, and they can stop by and listen. And it's just like,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
sounds like a nightmare.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
But I feel like it does get easier. But also be constructive upon yourself to like, what really helps is if you watch a video of yourself, it's super uncomfortable. Have you guys done? Oh, yes, no, I just like cringe. I'm just like, I just want to vomit. I can't do it.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You know what's worse is listening to your voice on a podcast.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Let's do that all the time.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It's terrible.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Leave these podcast people.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
podcast, I have to say very meta, all of a sudden, we are doing a form of public speaking now. It's more informal. But we are

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
staring at us though. That is you.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
first started, like being on the show I like my hands would get super sweaty before the show would start I get like really nervous. I'm like, I really have to be super careful about what I say and like be really thoughtful. And I wouldn't say things as much and like it does get easier. get easier.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's also because we drink it does help.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
There's something to be said for maybe having a shot before.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Not a technique.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I wish I had but

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
yeah, no, I think I think I don't know, it gets easier in a sense. And that it gets easier to manage. I would say at least for me, the nerves never go away. They're always there. But you're either you're able to handle them in one way or another. And so like an order JSA literally went out on stage. Okay, guys, I'm really nervous. Let's do just like you're, you know, upfront with the audience, and you tell them and everyone has different ways of managing that type of stress. But you know, the more you do it, the easier it is to manage the nerves and the stress and the shakings wedding. Yeah, I

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
think like the, the process gets easier. So you understand more about like, what it means to like, attend the event, to be in the Speaker's circle to, like, go up on stage to have a mic put on you all those things are like the first time is like, sort of terrifying. But then after that the process becomes more like is easier because you know what to expect. And maybe every event is like slightly different how they do things, but at least like that's not the stressful part anymore the stressful parts than just giving the actual

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
that's fair, because all that setting up can be nerve racking, like well, what if I screw something up on that or don't know what I'm where I'm supposed to go? Who I'm supposed to meet with? Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I don't have a Dongle for me than what works, bring dongles, like

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
other good advice, too, is you know, just like the technical difficulties of I've seen on Twitter, I think maybe it was one one someone here and this group started this conversation. And it was about, you know, make sure you have everything downloaded offline. Yeah, that's a pretty big deal or have a hard cut. Like if you really are reliant on your notes have a hard copy, because there's no guarantee that you'll be able to, you know, unmarry your display is or you've no idea what's going to happen to your second display. And that was that was pretty interesting to me. It's just you know, being able to make sure you'll have your content. You don't have to freak out

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
about Yeah, don't rely on conference Wi Fi chairs. There's lots of great advice i Mars. That was actually a tweet that I sent out and I was impressed with a lot of responses, and all really good. Good advice. I think one that I've always said to people. I've always said practice your talks so much that you just are sick of your Talk, I think that is so powerful. It's something that I've done many, many times where I'm just like, I don't even find this interesting anymore. But the thing is, I know that well, it's like, I can just give it in my sleep. And I think that to me is when I know that I'm comfortable going up there. And it also, I find my delivery is a lot more natural. It's not scripted. Even though I know what I'm wanting to say it just comes off a lot more natural

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
piggyback on that, I'd say, Don't memorize your talk. I. I know that goes against counter advice, but I just don't think people should memorize or talk. I think it makes you really stiff. And if something happens, someone raises a question or the your computer goes to sleep or something like that, you're just starting off and then trying to get back. It's just, I've seen so many people fumble and stumble doing that. If you just have notes, but like you know, use them for guidance during practice, and then later, just let it flow naturally. You know what you're talking about, you know what the slide says, If not, like change your slides or help you guide your talk. But yeah, don't memorize your talk. I think it's it's the wrong way to go.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I don't think I memorize it. But I think of it is like I know what I'm talking about on each slide. And so I think that's kind of what you're getting at is I use those slides as the hint. And I know what I want to say, it's not word for word, memorize. It's more I want to cover these points. And this is and then I just say it as I would normally speak and I think that's more natural.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah. Because if you if you have a script, then you're just thinking of the next line the next line rather than the impact of the line you're saying at the moment. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think that's pretty interesting. Actually, I think that kind of rolls into something I wanted, like a piece of advice I had for other speakers is that just part of having a script sometimes is not being comfortable with the silence, or with being up there. And like, you know, meaningful pause or losing yourself or anything. And one of the best pieces of advice I got is, you know, two seconds to you on stage probably feels a lot longer than anyone in the audience. And having pauses that are well timed, can actually be really impactful for your talk. But also, don't be scared of a pause, just be like, Okay, I kind of lost myself for a second there. And then and then look back at it and take the time to compose yourself again and continue. It's not going to, you know, break the audience's respect for you just that one, two seconds, or however long it is,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
the pauses are really hard. Like they are another really scary

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
but I think it's something to be that's really important to be comfortable

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
with. Yeah, and know that it feels so so long for you. But it's really actually no one even notice the pause right?

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Actually, pauses can be super powerful and public speaking can create, like, I want to hear what's coming up next. Yeah, my public speaking class a great pause.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
That's that's pretty advanced, though. I think mastering a pause is very, very difficult. Just like you said, two seconds to you, feels like me feels like forever, but it's only two seconds. And it's nothing to the audience, but to yours. Like,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think Master is one thing, but I think you know, guys starting out, and it's important to start getting comfortable with them. It's gonna take a while, obviously, but I think it helps to relieve the stress of Oh, no, I'm lost. Be okay with it, you know, and move on.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And you don't even have to say anything to the audience. Like, you don't have to apologize or say, Hey, I'm lost or anything like that. Just pause, because they have no idea what you're trying to deliver, right? They don't know. Or if you screw up what you were supposed to say they don't really know, they've never seen it before, which I think is kind of smart in that way, too.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I think that's why humor is probably where most people start because you put something funny, it's a natural pause for people to laugh, you laugh to look around, it's a good way of getting that pause in there. Yeah, but if they don't laugh back, then it's like, twice as bad.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Humor in my next talk, and I'm worried that I'm gonna find it funny. So

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
my strategy is to have a very obnoxious fake laugh. And then people usually laugh at that.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Advice that I would give

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
with this guy's jokes.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Or you pay someone in the audience to just laugh really loud.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Actually, if you have co workers in the audience, they'll be supportive enough to give you some sort of like a little bit of a chuckle laugh track. Track,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
it's worked for TV shows. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
that's a great point mark. We didn't even talk about have an anchor in the audience. So and you know, someone that's gonna like not along no matter what you're saying and like, therefore, you it's, it's like, hard to overstate the importance of that, like how how powerful it is, especially when you get lost or they're not laughing your joke just so in there. A lot of times Ryan and it's looking I was like, yeah, yeah, just like keep going and

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
anchors you to that one spot to where if you feel nervous or something you'd look at that person they've got you got your back here. I'm sitting here. That's a good point.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I've got my first talk, React Rally. Yeah, I totally like just lost it in the middle. I just totally lost just freaked out. Like it finally hit me like 15 minutes in and I saw someone I knew in the audience, they're just like, go ahead. And like it just brought me back like instantly but other than that, I've just like panic and I don't have notes. It's just yeah, have an anchor find someone you know that like, likes you

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That goes back to my original point to just before that that I said that the audience doesn't know that your screen up I had no idea that was the first time I'd met you was at React Rally saw you speak. To this day, I did not know that you screwed up. I was like, holy shit. This is an amazing talk. So that's the thing is like, I had no idea that you screwed up. I was sitting in the audience and saw that talk. So

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
there you go, I thought was dramatic pause. Probably. So great. He's leaving

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
me hanging I want to know more. Is this happened in a view where like, when I if I'm extremely nervous, I almost it's almost like a blackout. Like, I don't even I'll get done with being speaking. And I'm like, I have no idea what I just said. Or if it was right, like, hopefully it was right. And like, that really freaks me out. Because like, that's like the thing that what prevents you from wanting to do it again? Because you're like, oh, like, how do I how do I not have that situation happen? And I've seen other people post about it too. Like, yeah, I just, I totally don't even remember what I said, when I was up on stage.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think that pretty much always happens to me. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I don't know if it's good or bad. Because like, you're you're I think it's bad because you're not able to self assess while you're doing the talk to say to be aware, and like, adjust, but then maybe I was and then I just forgot about it afterwards. I don't know. Like,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I know the feeling. I know exactly the feeling that you're describing. But yeah, I don't know if it's, it hasn't hurt me at all. Maybe it has maybe it was terrible. I'm unaware.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I've actually had that happen a lot. Like I just completely lose my train of thought I don't even Yeah, I don't know what I said. And the worst part is, I don't know what I was gonna say next. And so actually, when starting off like our public speaking classes, they they actually encouraged us to use flashcards. And if you like use your flashcards like really smoothly like people don't even really notice it. Right? Like they focus on you talking not really what you're like Cannes or doing or whatever. So if maybe that helps. But yeah, practicing helps so much with that

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I to do the blackout thing, where it's, I look at it more, it's kind of like riding a bike. Like you're riding a bike, you have some goal in mind, what are you trying to get to you're not at the end of the thing. At the end of the bike ride, you're not thinking of like every pedal stroke you took or that person or that hill, you climb, unless it's like really big. He's like, Yeah, exactly. But all you know, is you got to where you're trying to get, and you've probably got there as best you can. And that's the way I look at talks is like you don't think about stuff like you couldn't possibly like when we walk out the door, we're not gonna think about that. We just think about where do we end up? And hopefully we did it. Well. That's, that's just rehearsing like a lot of rehearsal.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
One thing that I think is really important, too is this is kind of goes along while you're prepping for the talk. But think about what the audience is going to take away, like I think we briefly touched on that is what do you want the audience to take away? And then at the end of your talk, summarize it, what do they want? What do you want them to take away that you just talked about that entire, you know, 20 minutes, and then you've got like two minutes to close. just summarize it. And I think that can be really, really important as bringing everyone back. These are the key takeaways. And I find that some people just end abruptly and then I'm like, Wait, are we done? And so I think having a good summary is really important. We think about getting all the content and the intro. What about the ending? Don't just throw up like, thank you.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I totally

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
did that earlier. Today.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I practice talking on you, Mark,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I know you're not but it's very relevant.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Ryan, you said it before, but like more directors more like I just finished a talk with you. And it just, why should it? Why should anybody care? Like, why should I care? And like, what am I supposed to learn from this? And I'm like, Yeah, give a whole 30 minute talk. And if he doesn't know what I'm trying to what the whole point is, then like, what am I doing? And it's like, hard to hear sometimes, especially if someone like gives the whole talk. It's really good. But it's important, like if you don't know, then Tony doesn't know you at all, or didn't know anything about you. Like they're not gonna care.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You have the great content, but it's just making it really easy for someone to interpret. Yeah, what is the takeaway here,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
and it makes like crafting your talk so much easier. Once you figure out like, these are the points that I want someone to take away. So you can just reference back always to those and it just, it makes it all flow so much better.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Yeah, I think that's hard to remember sometimes. Because to you, the talk is already interesting, you know, you already enjoy it. You already are talking about something that you think is really fun. And again, I think that's where having a good support system really someone you can bounce ideas off of is really important because they need to be able to tell you well yeah, that was interesting. But what am I supposed to take away from this? What am I supposed to take home I know you find it interesting, but how are you going to make it relate and that also I think ties back to the whole know your audience thing and and having that good support system kind of prepares you for a larger audience just exposing yourself to one more perspective on your talk will get you ready to hundreds of perspectives in the audience

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
and find someone to give you honest feedback not You did well if I look rehearsal for my mom, every one of my talks first time through be amazing. Yeah. But that's fine. That

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
person who is going to pick out it and totally give it to them

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
as a as like a counter or as an addition to that to like be open to feedback. I mean, you can go into that and someone can give you great feedback like, yeah, no, I don't like that, you know, do you know what I mean? And I think it's really important to go into a talk or into a practice session, knowing that no things are going to have to change, it's always going to evolve. And the talk just because the slides are done now doesn't mean that those are the slides are gonna present in two days.

I mean, be prepared for change be expected, um, you know, it's always

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
longer than two days, or four days. But you could, it may be a good piece of advice would be to present it in smaller venues or small. So not just like getting feedback, but actually do it at like, maybe a small arena, or meetup first. And then, you know, eventually work up to like, Oh, I'm going to submit this to a conference.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think that not only helps you in terms of fleshing out the talk, and making sure it's ready for a larger audience, but also, sometimes larger organizers of larger events. Kind of look at that as a good sign as you You've done this before. This isn't fresh and inexperienced to larger events. And meetups is important. So you need to find a way to work up to that for I think, for multiple reasons.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Alright, so before we end the episode, each episode, we like to share pics of things that we found interesting and would like to share with our listeners. Let's go around the table and share pics. I guess this Where do you have? Oh,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
cool. Yeah, I have two pigs. One is a site, let's see shells.io, which apparently you can pipe like, terminal output, and it comes out it like generates a link. So you literally like do like, I don't know, build on your terminal anyway, it'll spit out a bunch of tests or whatever. You can like pipe it to this site. And then it'll generate like a unique URL. And then it like makes a public URL for anyone to see. So like, I was like doing tests. And then I could just like, show it to another dev or something.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And so it just makes your environment public. Yeah, I

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
guess so. We care. So they delete the links every 24 hours. Okay. Yeah, I don't know. That's still pretty cool. That's pretty

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
cool. Your environment or just the output? Just the app. Okay. Okay. So none of the variables.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yes. Pretty cool. So the second one is this animation that got really popular on Reddit. It's called the working man. This guy just made this animation. I thought it was really, really well done. You could feel like what he was feeling like as a like an artist, you know, about what it feels like to be working like a job. Intense job.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Jem, what do you have?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I have two picks. The first one is the new Firefox coming out Firefox, the quantum engine, Mars and I saw your pick. You're making it? No, no. Okay. Just make sure. Yeah, I was born at Mozilla believe in the open web. And not just Chrome was awesome. But like, it's important to have diversity in our browsers just so we cover all the bases don't have an Internet Explorer. And Firefox has made a multi process browser that's much faster than the original. I use, I think use the beta at home. And it's way way better than used to be Yeah. It's really, really fast. And it's cool to see Mozilla just making strides like that. My second pick is a movie called the room. This one's a little bit more San Francisco centric. But there's a terrible, terrible movie called one of the worst movies of all time called the room. It was shot partially in San Francisco, partially Los Angeles. But it's so bad that they do midnight screenings around the world. So it's not just San Francisco. But I went to midnight screening and it is one of the best things I've ever done in San Francisco by far. And they haven't been I think a lot of major cities, but it's just so bad. So my advice is watch at home your friends. You'd like yeah, this is a bad movie. Watch it in a theater with people who just know how to nitpick everything and it's just so much funnier. It just I was laughing for two

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
hours. Yeah, I can see that is like as a group just picking at it. So the whole audience does or everybody does that's amazing.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
But there's I don't want to get too much into it. But in part of it, they just didn't plan the props properly. So in the background, there's a picture of like, kitchen utensils in the house because they didn't like that empty picture frame sounds like just fill these with something so as kitchen utensils so every time you see a picture of the like the background everybody throws spoons at the screen. Just everybody just grabbed plastic spoons and just throws them it's that's like one small example of like, did

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
they give those to you as you walk in? Like here are the spoons with her later who brings plastic spoons?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Bring your own buddy it's just it's a good time. So if you have a chance check in your major city probably United States but some in Europe, but the room it's worth it's worth saying.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Do you like Mr. Science Theater? 3000 I love that kind of like that. You're like everyone's just like commenting and making fun of it while it's playing.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yes, but much funnier because everybody's drunk. Most of the time. It's midnight on usually Saturday.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right, Stacy, what do you have?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I have to Music picks. First one is Illumina by lamp, they've they haven't put out anything in quite some time. But they've been around forever since like the late 90s downtempo Drum and Bass duo. It's a really great song super excited to see new stuff from them. And then the second one is a new release by burial are called wrote it. He is very elusive and he hasn't put out anything new in a really long time. And it's a really great track. But I also because I just listened that track, I started digging in him a little bit more and listening, watching this mini documentary about how he produces some of his his music. It uses like, like, Sound Forge Pro to create some stuff, which doesn't is not like what you would normally use when you're doing electronic music to like, have crisp loops of you know, drum tracks and stuff like that. It's like it's a very weird tool to pick and I think that's why his music is so interesting, because it's not very formulaic or sterile. It's got a lot of idiosyncrasies to it and so hard to remix. There's like, it was a very, was a interesting mini documentary to watch. But anyway, new song is awesome. So check

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
it out. Right now.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I like the remix two byte code nine. Yeah, I think it's solid,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Maurice? Well, yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I have two picks. They are both kind of San Francisco centric. And I think I chose this one in a previous episode. But it's more relevant than ever. One because I'm working on the talk for this and to the talk is on Friday. So in San Francisco, there's an html5 meetup that I myself and co worker Tony will be speaking at. So if you're in the area, we'd love to see you. Although this episode might not come. As I was saying. They would Yeah, it will be recorded, and it will tweet that later or something. And the second is, I think I picked this about a year ago. So it's, it's really fun. If you're in the Bay Area, or San Francisco, the dickens Fair, which is Victorian London at Cow Palace, and it's really really engrossing. It's really interesting, they do a really good job with all the costumes and the props, and lots of fun drinks and you know, period shops that you can go to. So if you're looking for something really super festive, I would highly recommend it. And one of my really good friends plays the queen. She's also a software engineer. So if you want to go support her, that would be fun.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Has she not been on an episode two? Oh, yes.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
She's also a bit yeah, she was one of the panelists on the imposter syndrome episode. Jessica Grist. Right on,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
do you dress up for it?

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Um, so the first year I went, I didn't and I mean, it was still fun. Don't get me wrong. The second time I went dressed up and it was just way more fun. You people, you know, you're more of the community. They the actors. They're like, Oh, you get it. You totally get it. And they're way nicer to you. But I mean, they're nice anyways. It's just a different level of camaraderie.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Definitely. People speaking of bridges, everyone speaking. Oh, they

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
do? Yeah, I mean, all the actors and actresses do but none of the visitors.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Oh, Mars, Mars this year. I know the

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
full British. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right. I have two picks as well. One is the obey giant documentary to really interesting story of obey and the artists behind it, which is Shepard Fairey. So original Hulu documentary. I just really enjoyed it. I've always liked his work, but I found the documentary was really well done. So definitely recommend checking that one out just came out this week. And then since we're on some San Francisco picks I chose a restaurant that I really like is one that gem and Augustus and I have all been to recently but is southpaw. It's like a barbecue place and they have like the best beef brisket I've had the like I honestly think it's probably hands down one of the best that I've had and have really good cocktails there too. So I highly recommend that if you're in San Francisco or visiting go check out Southpaw in the mission. Delicious.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I will attest this to right on
