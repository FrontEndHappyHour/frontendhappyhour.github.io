<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Welcome to a brand new episode of the front end happy hour podcast. In this episode we are joined by Michael to talk with us about career management. Michael, can you give a brief introduction of who you are, what you do and what your favorite happy are beverage is? 

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
My name is Michael Gaskill. I'm a director of engineering at Lendinghome. So I coordinate people throughout the day, my happy hour drink favorite is a mezcal, Paloma? Sweet and smoky. And what's all in a mezcal? Paloma? So, mezcal, yep, grapefruit juice, typically, a syrup of some kind. And then Mine happens to have a salted rim, which is delicious.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I'm drinking the same. It's delicious. It's really good. Jem. Jem spoiled us a bit today. Nice. All right. Well, let's also go around and give introductions of today's panelists.

Jem, want to start off? 

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Jem Young senior software engineer at Netflix 

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Augustus Yuan, senior software engineer at Twitch 

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Stacy London, senior front end engineer at Atlassian. 

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix. In each episode, the front end happier podcasts we like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all in the episode, we will all take a drink and what did we decide today's keyword is?

</p>
<p><strong>All</strong><br />
reflect

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
reflect. So if anyone says the word reflects reflections, we will all take a drink.

All right, well, let's jump right in.

What does career management mean to each of you?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
always happens we all

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
go first. Yeah, who's going for

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I never want to go first because I always have some say.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Try to maybe should once then Jem, come on.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
That was well played.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Checkmate move that I've seen when I the way I look at it is is a job is something you do currently to, you know, eat have roof over your head, stuff like that career is your overall trajectory through multiple jobs and throughout life when I think career management, I think you need to have a plan to gain that track trajectory somewhere, otherwise, you'll end up somewhere like, you're gonna have to work unless you get lucky or you marry so incredibly wealthy, or, you know, you kill a guy and steal his money. But you're always gonna have to work. So it's smart to manage that trajectory about where you want to end up when you're say 50 or 60 or 70.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, I think like, career management is also for me about it's all those things and then also trying to make sure you're thinking what do I like doing what what is making me happy and making sure that the career or the path that you've chosen, you know, matches that because maybe it doesn't and then you have to maybe, you know, pick a different career and make some really big choices, but that that kind of stuff, I think fits into it quite a bit.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, I just want a second both of those points. And really just like, when I think of career management, it's like separating long term goals and short term goals. And it's really important to think of the long term goals of where you want to be in your career, or where you want to be in general in life, and then saying, Okay, well, if these are my long term goals, what can I do right now in the short term to actually meet those goals? I think we've kind

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
of covered a rough idea of what career management is. I'm curious for all of you what is the best career decision you've ever made going forward so far? 

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
For me it was actually moving to the Bay Area after many many years of, of working in say, smaller tech sectors. Moving to the Bay Area was was actually a fantastic move for me.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I'd have to second that too. Like I found that was a pretty great move to just be in, in Silicon Valley working with like a lot of amazing people. Being in the heart of tech without that was something that that was The main reason why I moved so I'm happy I've done that too. And then I would say another one that I was thinking about was quitting jobs that weren't challenging. Like, I think sometimes you know that, hey, this is just not a good maybe it's not even just challenging, maybe it's just not a good job. And knowing when to pull the plug,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I like that. There's a few good moves I've made. Obviously, I end up in a pretty good place. But one of the, the ones that I recommend the most, and what you just said is switching jobs when you know, you're not learning anything. It's really easy to be comfortable as a human. It's what we do naturally. Like we like our routine, we like knowing what's coming up next. And I've seen a lot of smart people miss out in my opinion, this is definitely my opinion, like everybody has their own career goals. But I've seen people that often like you know, if you moved to New York or the Bay Area or somewhere else, like not where you are, you could do so much more and you can impact so many more people but they're like, Well, you know, interviewing is hard and I really got a good here and I get a 10% raise every year and I know it's coming down the pipe and it's it's really easy to be comfortable. So, the best career moves I've made are ones that get me out of my comfort zone and it was scary and I didn't know what was gonna happen. But you got to take a chance somewhere and that's if I had life advice it's you won't become successful without taking chances. You just won't like you have to gamble sometimes and hope and trust yourself that you made the right call.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
But I also want to second which gentlemen Michael said like honestly, I was at Evernote for like five years and I love Evernote is a great, great place to work. But I definitely felt I was getting very comfortable, wasn't learning as much as I could and honestly, I felt I was kind of taking a risk moving to twitch and but I like love it so far because I'm learning so much like it's just like so many things to learn and honestly, like, I don't think I could have ever found that kind of experience at Evernote. I probably could have found like other experiences, but I've been learning a lot. So

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think sometimes you can still be challenged at a company or even in the same role like you could move roles in a company and find new challenges, or you could stay in the same team or the same role. And they're constantly our challenges. It just it depends, like, I've definitely been in cases where I'm like, I'm not going anywhere new challenges in this particular role. And even in the company.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, I would say, switching jobs every you know, so many years, I think has been a very good decision on my part, because I, I feel like you get diversity of experience where you see how, you know, different companies do things and how they develop software is different between those companies. And you start to gain perspective about like, what actually works and what doesn't work. And it helps you become I think, not only like a better engineer, but maybe a better business person, a better person for working for any company, because you've got that experience and you're like, Oh, we tried that at this other place, and that actually didn't work very well. And maybe you help the next place that you're at, not go down a bad path or, you know, it helps that I think a lot

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
you gain experience. And remembering all the things that you learned from the last time and being able to apply that which is really cool. I think like early early on best advice or like think back to is like, not listening to my dad telling me the internet was a fad and wasted. Like going in software development, I remember him being like, I don't think that plays is kind of a waste, like you got to do something different. And I'm so thankful that I never listened to that. So there's a perfect start of my career of advice. Don't listen to what my dad said,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I think I've been pushed a lot to not be a front end engineer or web developer like, and for me personally, my, the, I think one of the best choices I've made, is realizing that that is something that I really like doing. And I'm not going to listen to people that try and push me into those other paths because I know I'm not going to necessarily be happy in those in those places. So just being aware of what you like and standing up for that because companies will you know, want to push you in places maybe that you don't want to do and and you're going to be miserable. probably not going to do good work like, you know, take take, take time to listen to what you like to do in May and then stand up for yourself too. I had this other reflection recently. It was needed. Have another reflection. Ah, gee.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah. That wasn't even played for,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
okay. It's an infinite loop. We can't get him out.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I was looking in the mirror just now. And just always finding ways to wrangle away from the keyword. Yeah, I also for whoever the younger listeners who might be still be in college. I was kind of looking back at when we talked about the intern episode. And I definitely still believe this. You can totally find this. It's so so competitive right now to like, find jobs. There's so many jobs, but then there's also so many people trying to get into tech right now. And one of the biggest things that really helped me and I felt was very redefining was applying very early on Then basically getting crapped on a bunch of people at the career fairs. I actually, I didn't even know what I was doing. I I had like zero tech experience on my resume when I was a sophomore in college and I went to this career fair, as a recruiter, looked at my resume. It was like pretty much insulted that I gave him. Where is it? He's like, there's like nothing on here. Like, you don't even have a major declared yet. Because that's just not that I just didn't so so honestly. And that was kind of a wake up call for me. I think definitely. I felt uncomfortable going to that career fair. And this might go into what Jem was saying, you know, do things that make you uncomfortable, just like, try see what happens and, you know, really, like, get yourself set up like early on because it will pay dividends like in the future

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
while you're doing that, you kind of have to fight the imposter syndrome. You know, you have to be aware of that and consciously turn it down. I'm still learning.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I don't know how to fight that imposter.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
It's like a I think a challenge I have these days is Yeah, imposter syndrome, for sure. That's always gonna happen. But you're, you're actually fighting. I'm fighting my ego to where I'm like, I'm actually pretty good at what I do. And I have to remember like, there, there are tons of things I don't know. And it's like being a good software engineers that balance in the middle between like being an imposter and being like, overly confident. And like striking that middle is, I'll say near impossible. We're usually on one side of the other. And that is probably a lifelong struggle probably always have. There's no way around that.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah. overconfidence is a terrible thing.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Staying humble is

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
the middle ground. I got this when you were going to those career fairs Did you find obviously people were turning you down, but were you also making connections to because I could also see that being a good networking and making connections? Yeah, yep.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, it definitely was like I got I just grabbed business cards. And you know, I try to keep in touch with recruiters. But yeah, yeah, it definitely is. Definitely go to career fairs, not just like, get a sense of how, like where you are at but then also To make like connections, I also encourage people to just not even just career fairs like meetups in general, I feel that is like a really, really great way to like set yourself apart and meet new people because, quite honestly, the recruiting funnel, it's just way easier to get recognized. If someone internally refers you to somebody, most of my career has not been me cold submitting a resume on a random site where I don't haven't talked to anybody from the company and hoped that I would get visibility, not my job. So for that,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
yeah, it goes a long way. If someone can say, hey, Stacy's amazing. You need to hire her. Which I'm saying that what is the worst career decision you've all made? I'm sure there's, I'm sure there's more than one. But I'm curious on the worst one. Well, first, let's reflect because

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
you are on point. For me, one of the worst creative students I made was going to a job straight For the money, like I switched jobs because like, you know, it turns out I can make 50 k more this other job. And this my job that I had was underpaying me. So I switched jobs, because they were just gonna pay me more, but they're like a lot of red flags about like, this may not be the best place to work. And it was still like, I still got lucky and managed, meet some smart people and turn that into like a forward trajectory of my career. But overall, it was like a bad experience. And it was, it was a mistake. So I'd say that one of the worst career decisions I made, it's like going somewhere just because they pay you more, that's not the best

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
way to go. So I've had a couple of situations where, ah, I found a great company that I wanted to be at, but I was timid about negotiating and, and my lack of negotiating skills, particularly early on in my career was was was really a hindrance to, to me for years after that, which, you know, learning to negotiate is an important skill for for making sure your Your career moves like you want it to. That's a

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
tough one, too. I feel like I've never been good at negotiating. It's like, especially when you get the offer, you're excited. And it's like, oh, now I've got to negotiate, like salary. And that's it. It's tough. It's not an easy thing to do. I actually don't think I'm good at that either. But I guess the best advice for that is, what's the worst that they can say, hey, you're completely off base, like you're asking for way too much. How did you come to that conclusion? I mean, hopefully, you've put a little bit of thought into like, what you're throwing out there, but the worst that they can say is now sorry, we can't meet that. And then you still have to decide whether you usually never like rescind the offer or anything, if somehow they're afraid of that. That would be super rare. If you were like that, asking for a million dollars, like more than what they were offering,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
they might be like, might be like,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
maybe we should dodged a bullet here and that person is really not really clear on what they need or want. But I think if you're even if you're off a little bit, it's the no one's gonna fault you for that. I think they missed will not move. That's okay too. I mean, as long as you're okay, still taking the offer, you still get to make the final decision. I think one thing that I haven't done, which I feel like is been maybe a bad career management thing on my part is trying to find mentors or career mentors. I haven't done that. And I think I've been seeing how that's been beneficial to a lot of people that I've worked with where they you know, set up time with like, directors of directors or higher, you know, people higher up in the organization and just like to get advice and, and career path management type advice, and I haven't done that. And I'm, I think that I should I think that's probably a mistake that I haven't done that. Do you lean on like your manager for that, or? 

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, I guess so. I don't. Sometimes you feel like you don't want to waste people's time or like, everyone's time is really valuable. And you don't want to just set up random meetings with you know, execs and feel like that's, I don't know, there's like, you just I'm worrying too much about it. Probably you should just do it.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Probably Yeah, but I think it's also I think sometimes people just fall to their manager to do that, too. And I think one piece of advice I was thinking about, and I'm guilty of that, as well as not looking to other leaders in the company, or even peers, like appear can be a very good person to bounce ideas off of for career growth and like, also to give you feedback on things that you need to do to get there

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
outside your company. There are other avenues as well, you know, my company is hasn't one of our investors actually has a mentoring network, which is pretty fantastic. So you can just happen on that. And, you know, you can you can take advantage of anywhere from senior executives all the way down to, you know, entry level managers, as peers or as, as mentors.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So question for right and Michael and everybody else but you to manage people. So, what is the role of the manager in someone else's career growth?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Great question. For me, I think it is definitely a role. I think it's important to think about your team's growth are the individuals on your team to grow. I think more for the business in that in that sense to is that if I can help someone grow, they're going to be better because of it. And they're going to be better for the team, all these different things. So it's actually a good thing for the business. But I also think it's important as a leader to try and help others on the team just even for their own career growth. And that might mean that they're not on your team anymore to because there's opportunities somewhere else that is better aligned, even though it sucks losing them because they were great. It's like you want to make sure that they're progressing in their career. But that being said, I also feel like it's a partnership. It's not my job to dictate how someone's career as growth is, like I expect it to be a two way street almost even maybe less for me because I want that person driving a lot of it. I will support it. 110% but I also don't want to be like the one fully in the driver's seat. I should be in that passenger side seat, or maybe in the backseat like an Uber and telling them where to go. vaccine. I am not the driver at that point. I'm always willing to help someone but if if I have to feel like I'm the one driving, that's probably not the best thing.

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
Yeah, for me, I, you know, I kind of think of three different categories of people that that I would give advice to the people that report to me and I'll give them typically specific advice, usually related to the rubric and their, their actual performance and, and, you know, kind of guide them to you're looking for a promotion in such and such time, here are the things I would identify as areas of improvement and maybe how you can get there, you know, what things you can do outside my team, looking at people, you know, across the organization, whether they're an engineering or not giving them more general career advice and, and helping them navigate maybe difficult situations in the organization, which, you know, some people just have blind spots to those kinds of things. Somebody that they trust that can give them advices is usually helpful and then outside the organization. People who are at different stages of their career may be either trying to make a decision on which path they're going to take. Or likewise, you know, other situations that they may have encountered. I've mentored interns are sorry, not interns, college students a number of times where, you know, they initially we're looking for, you know, help getting through their, their, the technical aspects, but actually ended up giving them career advice on how to move beyond, you know, the sophomore year in school to getting your first job and looking forward to how to leverage that to your second job, things like that.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I like that to say to your point, too, about mentoring, if when you make it up as part of your career management is mentor other people just not just because it's the right thing to do. But it helps like talking to people who are earlier in the stage helps you reflect on what you're going to do, and it keeps you going to it's it's a really interesting perspective. It just seems like work from the outside, like Got it. I got to call someone up and talk to them every day or something like that, whatever it is, but it really helps you look back and think, Oh, yeah, this advice I'm giving I should follow my own advice too. And like shape your own career path. Also, I said reflecting.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
IRS is Yeah, I just also wanted to add, this is kind of related to what we were all saying. Especially what Ryan Michael you were both saying. I think one biggest mistake that I made early on my career was not properly taking advantage of the one on ones with my manager. like totally believe that the one on ones are very driven by you, like you have to drive your own career. Like I think it's great that the manager you know, will step in and help help navigate you but it's really on you to and it's as Ryan said, like it's really best if you can, like manage your own career. And like definitely take advantage of like your manager like helping you and giving you advice on how you can get there. Like I think early on in my in my one on ones I never really was like clear about where I want To go, I always just kind of was like, trying to work hard and then hoping at the end of the performance review that like, maybe promotion would happen and stuff. But if you have that conversation early on, your manager can really help you and guide you internally in the workplace, like what needs to happen. But another advice I would give is, don't be like so obsessed about promotion, like focus on like tangible things that will help you in your career in the long run. And then like that will eventually just like scream that you're like an excellent person, whatever you're doing,

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
there was actually an excellent article in medium not too long ago, I can't remember it's called you don't need a personal brand. You need to be useful. It is.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It is an amazing article. And it actually speaks to that. It's, you know, be the best you can be and grow. You know, from that you'll you'll actually get far more opportunities than you. If you spend time marketing yourself branding yourself. That's really good. I like that. And also to the one on one. I feel like we could do like a full episode on that. It's like the one on one is an interesting mean that there's a lot to be said on like, what the best value comes out of that. And a lot of it is asking those questions and talking about your own growth and I agree with you, it is your time with your manager to be asking those types of things

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
related to one on ones. If you ever get to your review cycle and you're surprised by the results you use, you should take that as a you know, that that's your your notice to to be more engaged in your one on ones. Yep. That's

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
good advice. Yeah. To your point i, that's some of the worst career management I've done is not taking manual one on ones not take advantage of like those meetings with the engineering manager like chances to speak with leadership. I and the Sigma performance reviews those time of year, twice a year through whatever how often the cadence happen. asking your manager directly like, Hey, I'm here. What do I need to get to the next level because they are your, your technical therapists, like they see your career from a third party standpoint and they're invested in you somewhat like not as much as you will no one will ever Just as you will but like having concrete questions to ask your direct manager to say like, Hey, you know, I, I thought I was doing better or I'm actually doing really well what's something I can continue doing? And to put me to the next level in your opinion? And like, that's a concrete question that managers love to get, and then can deliver, like concrete answers versus like, I want to be better, better, what? Better engineer? What does that mean to you? And then like, you know, you spend

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
a half hour trying to suss that out. I mean, if you ask me, yeah, I want to be better. I want to be a better engineer. What does that mean? Like, I have no idea. Like, that's a tough answer, or how am I supposed to solve that problem? It's a hard thing

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
and you like talk to 20 likely probably talk to 50 people under you like, they can't remember every detail of everything. But she asked them specific questions and those one on ones and say like, hey, specifically to me, what can I do that I think that that has got me the best advice versus like general

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
questions and hold them accountable to like, I think that's another thing is like, constantly bring it up. Like Like you said, Jem, they're talking about Many people, they may forget certain things. So it's like, hey, so we talked last time, you gave me advice that I need to do X, Y, and Z. I've done pretty good on X. I'm still working on Y and Z. Have you been able to see this? Like any feedback for me, like ask those types of questions, too? I think that can be really helpful. Yeah, kind

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
of always confirm where you're at every one on one, like, make sure that you have the same understanding of where you're at.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
With your manager. at Netflix, we have something called the keeper test. You can literally ask like, would you keep here? It's a double question ask but

I will say people on my team have legitimately asked me that like, do I pass your keeper test? And if they do, I will say yes, but if they don't, well, I guess I'm have to be pretty blunt and honest. And talk Why so? Yeah, that happens.

How do each of you please plan out your careers like do you each sit around and like think about it? Is it every six months? Is it like, how do you reflect? Cheers? Cheers. Cheers, cheers. But yeah, how do you plan your careers?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
My plan has been incredibly loose. My plan has been forever. Since the first time I went on the internet and learned that you can make something in a browser. I was like, I want to make things. I want to make things for the web. And that was it. And it's been that way. That's been the overarching strand throughout my entire career. And I figured, you know, I'm like, oh, at some point, I probably maybe that won't exist, maybe the web won't exist anymore. I'll totally have to like figure something else out. But so far that like, has has has kept me in the path that I am happy in and that I like, you know, doing but that's about as like, deep as I've gotten with figuring out what I want to do. I think that's fair, though. And of course, you've grown in that industry. You're continuing to grow in that industry. Yeah. And well, because it changes so Frequently, you're constantly like really almost relearning what you what your job is every few years when new things, you know are released new frameworks, all the things. So it feels like a new job constantly, which also probably helps that, that that probably has helped the fact that I haven't had to sit back and be like, what do I want to do? I'm so bored with making things to the web. It's gotten so boring, like, it's never boring. So

michael  
I've actually had to do that many times in my career. So I'm a little bit older than you. Well, all of you. The Internet didn't exist when, when I was

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
when I was early in my career,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I'm older than the internet. There's that on the internet. It's like 30 some years ago, exactly like that makes

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, that makes a difference because I might be older.

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
So I actually started as a preteen programming and wrote code for a few years and then realized, you know, I really wanted to go somewhere. At the point I was making that decision. I was a little sick. carefree and I thought there's no possible way I'm gonna make my college work. So I said, Okay, well let me see what my other options are. The Marine Corps actually had a fantastic program and offered discipline.Which I sorely needed at that point as a teenager. Yeah, maybe I need that. So I yeah, I took that. And, and then yeah, kind of kind of leveraged it to springboard into more high tech, which was, which was pretty cool. 

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's really cool. So yeah, you've definitely had to think about the career trajectory over your years of being a programmer. Absolutely. I've done systems level hardware, actually, you I I've done three different times, you know, web web at three different stages. 

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
I was you know, 1996 97 on the original like DHTML.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Oh, not really. That's when I started. No good.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah, even from them, like bringing Like the memories, all you had was console log, you didn't have debugger statements like that was not a thing. Oh, no, it wasn't console log. It was alerts. Yes.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Actually, as you said console log, I was like, No, no, no. Yeah. You were throwing alert, which you couldn't gain could have some fun with those alerts. Yeah, yes. They were obnoxious all the way to do something.

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
The other way actually was really to to expose a DOM elements, you know, so you can actually do that. That's true. Yeah, like tracing?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, I guess one I think I could put in or add to that is, once you get to a certain point in your career, you have to kind of try and decide because there's forking that happens. So you can decide to go maybe more people manager route or leading teams or stay more technical. And some companies don't offer those paths. Like there's companies of certain sizes that allow for that, but to kind of decide, like, no, I really want to keep going from like senior to principal, or staff or whatever the layers are, because maybe I'm self aware enough to know like, oh, management's not my thing. Or to go the other way. And those are those are big, like differences and career paths and their big decisions. And I think like really thinking that through so that you're confident when you know your managers like, hey, you're doing great. You want to lead this team, maybe you should go on this path, you have a good answer for that. Because you know, if you feel like if you want to do that or not, I love that you said it takes a lot of important planning, because that didn't happen for me.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You know, like, I was more on the technical lead aspect and demeanor lead front end engineer and like really love that. And I'd maybe thought management might be a thing but hadn't really thought about it as a career plan or really put that together. And then just all of a sudden, one day, here's a team, you're met. You're the new manager. And not that I hate that but it was it definitely got thrown in and I enjoyed it. I absolutely. While I'm still doing that, yeah, could have chose not to do that. But it was a complete new challenge. And I hadn't really planned for it and it was just kind of Throwing in my lap, and it was sink or swim. I was like, just below water. I don't know if I was like swimming, but just bobbing along.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I don't think I've ever told this story. But I was a manager for a split second. And it was a surprise also. And it was one of the most entertaining parts of my career ever because of how it happened. I was working for a startup. My managers, manager, or direct manager was like, hey, the team's getting really big. I was thinking maybe you'd be interested in managing like the UI team, like the front end. Would you be interested in that? I was like, Oh, let me think about it. You know, maybe that could open up some doors. Like there's some things I would like to do here. Maybe that would give me more. The opportunity to do that. So let me just think about it. As I'm thinking about it, the company was acquired. And we walked in one day. And we were told to go to room, conference room air conference room. Be which meant conference room it was keep your job conference room is not keep your job and conference room B people had to walk out I went to a thankfully but as part of going to conference in May you got packets for your new employment offer. And in that packet it said manager UI engineering and I had to sign it it's and basically like sign it or

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
be gone walk go to route go.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I was like, I guess I'm gonna be a manager I didn't really think about quitting today. So it was really intense. So I that's how it happened. It ended up being great and I really liked the team and I think I learned a lot. I eventually stepped back from that and went back to more ice kind of thing but yeah, surprised your manager that can happen. bad thing

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
stepping back from it either because I do think you get experience that will make you a A stronger individual contributor at that point, definitely.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I have the same thoughts about like, because I'm kind of there right now it's do I want to be a people leader? Or do I want to be a technical leader? And I was talking to one of my friends Cole at work. He's like, Jem, there's actually a third option. I was like, What do you mean? Because I was like, agonizing about like, which way do I want to go and still don't know. But he was like, now there's third option, you could just be a really good engineer, you don't have to be either. You can just stay current with everything and you don't have to lead you don't have to be a technical leader. Which is true. And probably most people end up there. We don't we always think we're gonna be natural leaders. But that's not true. You can just keep going the job the job never being a manager or leader.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I don't know. goodware.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah, that that's not for me specifically, because I think over time you become a leader but default, like if you had a company for 10 years, people are going to look to you whether you want it or not. You are responsible and the new people are going to come and be like, oh, Michael, how do I do this and it doesn't matter if you want to lead or not. You're going to So I don't recommend that. But we all most people end up there. Traditionally,

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
that's usually what I think of as technical leadership as opposed to technical management, technical management would be like what I do. So kind of hands on on the code. And then the third option is strictly people management, which is, you don't you don't deal with any of the technical aspects, maybe not even the project aspects. Different companies have different options on those and good companies have all three of healable.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
But I'll say this in general, in terms of career management, I've not seen many, at any company. I've not really heard of any software that offers a path to technical management. Like you don't really hear much from that side of people you hear a lot from like great VPS or great leaders, but they're leaders of people. You don't hear people like his example of technical leader like john Carmack, like famous created Doom like, yeah, it's software like really famous like Guy, definitely a technical leader, someone that leads leads the way in terms of like VR and things like that thinking about, like how he creates spaces in 3d. But that's a technical leader, but you don't see them going out giving speeches on here's how I became a technical leader very often. And that's something I struggle with too. Like if I want to become a great engineering leader, like really tactical, what's the path to do that?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Hmm, that's a great point.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I think it's harder to find. I think that's why it's like, that's what makes it really difficult for people to see or understand. Because I don't think there is a single path towards it.

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
I think it comes to actually developing the strong technical skills, like really establishing trust in your own organization, on the technical level, and also demonstrating that you have really good people skills. Once you have those, you're you're kind of naturally fit for that type of role. And, and people will gravitate towards that. That's true.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I think the one of the issues is not every organization has that like right oftentimes what'll happen is you'll be the best engineer in organization like you can, I mean, not often, but you could be like stellar, you know, all the code inside out, you know, the architecture, you're always the one creating things people know to go to you. But because you don't have a title change, and you don't have a title of like, manager, you don't necessarily get recognized for that. So it's really trust in a company to say, Oh, crap, this person is actually really good. And they should be paid the same levels of VP or something, because that's the level of impact they have. But you find that it's some large companies, but oftentimes, smaller companies, they don't have that concept of of that. So it's something just switched jobs all the time.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I don't know if this is the right way of going about career management. But the way I've been doing it is I think management is something I'm interested in. But I also just love engineering. So I've just been trying to find ways to dabble in management. So looking for tech lead opportunities or managing a project and really like specking out trying to find opportunities to spec out projects and stuff. And then so and so it's like really focusing on what One things I can do in the short term to achieve those long term goals. But at the same time, I'm also like saying, well management is also something I'm not interested in if I want to be a very, very senior engineer, what are like things I would need to learn or what are things I would need to know how to do, or what I would want to know how to do to be a senior engineer. And I try to just like add little stepping stones for myself, I don't know if you if any of you have thoughts on that. That's just I think that's such a good one is

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
try try the things out Yeah, like eat it. And that's okay,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
the last thing and this is something I thought was really cool. I've never seen any other place that I've worked they have this path called associate manager where you try it out. Basically you take on that role for like a certain number of months or period time period. And then at the end of it you know, you both have the discussion like do you Did you like it? Do you think this is where you want to continue going? And then the reverse I'd like the company thinks you did a good job and if that's not matches, and you know, keep going with it, but I thought that was really cool because I think some people I think maybe I want to do management, but not to just totally swap and go full on and do direct reports at that time.

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
Yeah, it was a lendinghome. We don't have a separate role for that. Any engineering manager, anybody can, can ask to try it out. Try it out for as long if you realize two weeks in you're, you're not gonna like it, you can just step back.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's cool. Which I started with a little bit in the sense that I feel like you have to almost give it a year, like I don't know, maybe it's not a magical year, but I feel like you really have to give it a while. Before you truly know. I like the hints of it, though, is like are these types of tasks that I want to do, but I think it once you're in it, especially with direct reports, it's like, you got to figure that out for a little while there should be a bit longer of a timestamp.

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
It's kind of like Jem was talking about earlier, getting out of your comfort zone. You can really only figure out if you like it once you figure it out.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
for ya, right like the two weeks you're like oh, This is the worst thing ever. And then like two weeks later, it's like, wow, I think I figured some things out. Yeah. Agreed. All right, before we get into pics, I'm curious. We kind of roughly I some ideas around how to better plan for your career. But I would love to, you know, at some loss advice for our listeners, what advice would you give for planning someone's career?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I think I've given this advice on a few other episodes, but I continue to revisit it because I think it's important I was just having lunch with a friend today who did this same thing is the values spreadsheet. So right on a spreadsheet, the various characteristics of things you're looking for in life, and then match that up with a company and what they offer. So like, if you really value work life balance, make sure the company that you're looking at and the role you're looking at offers it and then kind of put weights on those things. And then it just helps you make a decision that's really kind of a complicated decision weighing all those things in your head. It makes it nice and clear. nerdy nerdy spreadsheet how to make it very clear to open sources spreadsheet. Maybe I should.

Maybe it's my next startup idea.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah. Stacy stole mine? Well, not exactly. I but well, okay. So there's, there's three things. Two of them we've already talked about, which is once starting early, and then the second is, you know, really take advantage of the one on ones. But the third one that I was gonna say, which is pretty similar, what Stacey was saying is really write it down and do like check ins every now and then, like, like, really concrete write down. What is your like, career goal? Maybe like, if you want, you can do like five years, 10 years, and then write why. And actually like something that my current manager he like, started challenging me saying was, so I told him Oh, you know, management is something that I'm curious about, and I'm interested in, and he would ask me, why are you interested in that? And I'll try to list reasons. And then he asks, ask the question, which is really hard to answer. He's like, Okay, well, you could find Those things in other roles. So why management, and they really makes you start thinking about why that is something you want to do. So I definitely think really writing it down, write the reasons down and then revisiting it every now and then really like helps you align in what you really want.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I'd say the one on one advice is great, like have have concrete questions, ask your directs manager that like have concrete answers, not like, well, I want to do better, I want to be more impactful or something like that, like ask hard, firmer questions, so they can respond to you in a firmer way. In general, it's a like you, you would say you're saying I guess, like have a plan, have a five year plan, have a 10 year plan. Don't just like, bounce around. It's really easy, especially when you get your first job and then you're like, well, I want to do something a little different to your second job. And before you know you're like 60 and you just bounce around didn't really have a firm plan, like have a plan of some sort. Because you have to manage your career or it will manage you you You'll end up somewhere one way or the other. I think my last advice would be if you're moving to a company, look how they treat career management, like, look how they treat the people on the way out. And do they celebrate that? Do they say like, Stacy's moving on She's like a manager. She's moving to like, some harder technical role at some other company. Good for her like that. That's what we hope for everybody. We want everybody to do better or is it this kind of push you out? And they're like, Oh, yeah, they left don't worry about that. And I've seen both. And those have been great reflections on the culture of the company more so than almost anything else I've seen. I am sorry, I said the last one, but one one more one. Make friends with people who are like aspirational, who want more out of life because you you will become who your friends are and the people you associate with so if you associate people are like, I want to be Distinguished Engineer Microsoft someday. Like you watch these people and they'll slowly get there. You want to be friends with those people and like you want them to motivate you in life because you will you are who your friends are eventually So like find those people that are just like smarter than you and and better than you and like really want things in life. And that is a good way of just like, motivating yourself.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Cheers. He said he said the word share did wonders.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I didn't listen. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
yeah, I've just really want to drink so.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
So I also like what you're kind of playing off that a little bit gem too, is that I think, even just straight up asking the company when you're interviewing with them, what does growth look like? What are some like trying to understand what growth looks like for certain engineers on the team or for the management path? Many different paths? Because I don't think like, unless you really truly know that I want to be an engineering manager at some point. That could be one path, but I think also just asking what growth has looked like for others on the team as well. I just

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, I just added a new interview question into my list. Like, when was the last time you promoted someone and why when you're talking to them? That's a great question.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Wow. That's a fantastic question.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I'm scared to ask that question, but it's a great question.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You know, what I guess is get out of your comfort zone. 

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
It's true. That's true. No, that is a really good question. 

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think another thing is don't get bogged down by the tactical things. I think a lot of times we think about like, especially as engineers is like, I want to learn a certain language or I want to be better at performance, or those are all great things. But thinking about when you're thinking about career management, it's a broader spectrum. It's like those are little tiny steps that may lead to what you want, but really reflect on like, what it is you're looking for. Cheers,

</p>

cheers, kind of just the last thought on that is be flexible. Don't be rigid. Be open to new things that come up. We work in technology, things change all the time. You can't make a five year plan and expect that five years from now is going to look exactly like us now. Be open to new opportunities. You know you you may you may not know what's coming around the band and, and sometimes your short term plan doesn't look at all like, you know, what, what, what your actual path ends up being. And sometimes that's a really good thing. So

</p>

I love that too. Because when you think back to us talking about really early on in the episode saying about a great decision we made was moving to the Bay Area. Like I made that decision in like a month like it was just kind of like, Alright, let's do this like it was there wasn't a lot of pre emptive thinking to that. So I think you're right like be flexible. I love that as an end note. All right at the end of each episode, we like to choose picks of things that we want to share with our listeners, things we've found interesting. Let's go around the table and share our picks for today's episode. I guess this

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Sure. So I have two picks. One is I'm starting to do a lot more go at ya. So twitch has a very heavy Go Go Lang a lot a lot of our microservices are written in go and so I've been learning go and I found a really awesome style guide that was written by Uber so I'll we'll have a link in the show notes so that's something that I've been looking at I thought it was really good and then the second one which happened which happens to be written go I was kind of surprised is a project called Open Diablo two and someone open source they created Diablo two, it's all open source on GitHub, and a lot of the code is written and go and I was like, holy crab cakes. This is insane. So that was really

Rach Nichols. find innovative words. 

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right, Stacy, what do you have two music picks.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
The first one is by a musician called Andy Stott, who I really really like probably one of my favorite electronic musicians. He just released a new album called it should be us. It's been described the See experimental dub techno Park Detroit techno part 80s adventure movie so give you give you a little taste of what that's like. And then the second pick is last night I went to go see sleater Kinney at the Fox Theater in Oakland, which was really really great. They just released a new album called the center won't hold sort of indie rock punk mix for genre. There are for a while the since the mid 90s. And Carrie Brownstein, isn't it so maybe you might be familiar with her? She's done portlandia the TV series so she's multitalented?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right, Michael, what do you have for us? All right,

</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gaskill</strong><br />
I think I have two picks. The first one's pretty straightforward. You some somebody has recommended freako camp before, but their code radio has not been and that's some sweet sweet jams to code by it's really amazing. Just even if you're not coding Which, you know, we're always kidding. Yeah. No, it's, it's really fantastic. Super enjoyable. And the other is, you know, my my drink of choice today I actually found it originally in the financial district in San Francisco at a bar called norango on the alley, which is utterly brilliant and if you have an opportunity about tried that one,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
okay, now I'm adding to the list. It's amazing. All right, Jem, what do you have for us?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I've got two picks. First one is I an article on alligator.io called CSS to Unix explained really helpful because there are units in CSS that I didn't even know about, like I didn't know about v min and V max and but they explained it between like percentage and Rams and M's and VH and vl. And like all these other things, which, like EAX. I'd never heard of that unit. But anyways, they explained it all really well. It's a really solid article in my Valley, silicon picture It's actually a throwback. Remember when I said I that hundred dollar toothpaste you bought it, I bought it. Well, this is this is good podcasting but this is the Odense 300 it is $100 tuba toothpaste. What? To be fair I didn't buy one of our loyal listeners bought it for me. Like I saw that on Twitter. Yes If you all want to brush your teeth with this hundred dollar to I'm sure your teeth will feel $100 richer. It smells through the box.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
What makes it $100?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean box feel like gold on the box. That is a nice box. It

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
says it's a revolution in oral care. 

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Oh, but it's not where does this ADA approved. But it's Wow. 

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's what the $99 is paying for is their backup insurance plan.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So if any of you have more ridiculously expensive things that probably shouldn't exist, but they do because people have to Money. Good. So that's me on twitter under hashtag Valley silicon. And if you want to buy more stuff, feel free like I will sell out so hard in a second.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right, I have two picks, both fairly relevant to our topic that we're talking today. Today. There's an engineer on our team Nazneen, she wrote a article on called the pivot point. It's really about how to excel in your career and pivot your growth along the way. It really outlines a lot about what we've been talking about today about thinking about the long term plan versus short term tactical. It's a really great read, I highly recommend reading that one. And then there's one of my favorite articles that I will always go back to when I think about giving feedback. It's called radical candor. And it's really about how to give direct feedback and actionable feedback. And I think there's a lot of really, really great material there. And to me, ultimately, when you're giving or receiving feedback, I think that's an important piece for your growth as an engineer. As a person, anyone in your career I think it's really valid. So definitely check out that article as well. Before we end the episode. I want to thank Michael, for joining us. Thank you. It was a pleasure having you. Where can people find you?
