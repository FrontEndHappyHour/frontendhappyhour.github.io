All right, well, welcome to a brand new episode of the front end Happy Hour podcast. We've typically recorded episodes biweekly, and we will continue to do that, but sharing more content is always fun. So we will also be adding a weekly episode that is interviews with people in the industry, get more insights about their careers and learn from them. I'm excited for our first interview session was with Chris Bautista. Chris works at Netflix as a senior software engineer. Funny enough, he was joining my team just as I was leaving. So I know he's going to give me some shade on this one, and I'm all for it. But Chris, welcome to front end Happy Hour podcast. Love to hear who you are, what you do, and what your favorite Happy Hour beverages. 

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
Sure, hello, my could be boss. 

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, you, you avoided a good it was a good thing for you. I think

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
 we'll never know. We'll never know, but there's

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
always a future time, Chris, there's future. I

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
know that's fair. That's fair. So to answer your questions, favorite Happy Hour beverage right now is my go to is a old fashioned I kind of use that to gage the level of the bartender, right? It's like, it's such a classic drink. So if I go to like, a nice place, I tend to get an old fashioned and I kind of keep like, a index in my head of like, Oh, that was really good here. And I can kind of, like, helps me get a baseline of what a good old fashioned is. So that's usually my go to where I'll just drink straight up with skate on the rocks. Bullet bourbon is like the easy, cheap one, but then you can go all the way up to, like, the really expensive Japanese ones. But yeah, I'm also, like you said, I'm a senior software engineer at Netflix. I am on your old team, unfortunately, yeah, and yeah, and I'm excited to talk to my quote, unquote, former boss, yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, I am sad we never got to work closely together like we'd always interacted here and there, even probably more on Twitter than we did actually at Netflix. And so I was really excited to have you moving from the studio org to our team and platform. Yeah, it was awesome to be able to do that I didn't know at the time. And then it's like, Hey, Chris, I'm sorry, but I'm leaving so, but you still joined a good team, so it worked out.

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
Yeah, I think it's funny that I just found out about the job itself through Twitter. So, you know Twitter, I forgot about

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
that too. Yes, oh, man, I still love Twitter. Yes. Like, Twitter is definitely a great spot. I feel like it's gone. Had its ups and downs in the past, like, couple years, like, just from the whole like, Elon Musk takeover and things like that. It's changed a lot, but I feel like it's starting to come back to what it used to be. I don't think it will ever be 100% what it used to be, but I'm feeling like there's more engagement and some good conversations happening. So it's nice to see.

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
Yeah, it's, it's a spiral, for sure. I remember when you tweeted that your team was looking I was like, This is it? This is the time, this time to shoot my shot. And I remember, I just DM June. You're just like, hey, just hit me up. I was like, All right, it was like, a super fast process too, which was like, really nice.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, you were already working at the company, right? Like, you should be pretty quick and painless. It's like, my goal there, when I'm moving someone internally, is, I'm just going to make an assumption that they're good, that they know what they're doing, like, especially baseline technology, they understand that. And, you know, I'm going to make that assumption. I can also ask their former manager, or their current manager, I guess, is at the point, like, they're there at the company, and can kind of understand that. But then the goal really is, is this the right team for you? Like, Chris, like, hey, is this something that you're interested in? Is it the right fit talk to some people on the team, figure out what we're doing. I'll answer any questions. And like, that was always kind of my goal, and I'm glad that it was really smooth for you, or really fast, because I have moved internally at companies, and Netflix being one of them, and I realized that there was such a everyone did it differently, and some of them were really painful, like I remember moving getting interviewed a ton, and I was interviewing at different roles within Netflix just to kind of figure out what I wanted. And I remember some of them were really casual and just like, checking to see if it was a fit. Then others were putting me through a full on interview. And I'm like, Oh, okay. Like, I mean whatever, but it was really inconsistent. And so I'm like, All right, I just want to be simple and figure this out. So yeah, my

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
main concern was like, do I have to do a full interview loop? Or can I just, like, can I just like, can you just talk to my manager and he'll, he'll tell you that I'm amazing or something. One thing I really liked is just how painless it was and just how supportive my previous manager was. He was great. But, yeah, I remember, I remember I reached out to you. I was like, Is this okay that I'm talking to you like, I feel like I was like, going behind someone's back, like, in a relationship, and. Like, I don't know, like, I felt like, really torn. Like, do I tell my manager that I'm talking to you? But then what if it doesn't work out, and maybe he gets upset and he wants to, like, not, like, retaliate, but you know, now it's like, now it's like, there, right? Like, I am now at risk, like, a flight risk, right, in their head at some point. So I was, like, very conflicted in many situations, or, like, in many scenarios, I was like, I hope this, like, works out very fast, and then we can move on. And that's

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
the way it should be, right? Like, your manager should be supportive, right? Especially if they're like, it sucks. It's a bummer, right? Like, as a manager, when I lose someone great, that they're moving to another team or leaving the company, it sucks. It's a bummer, right? But at the same time, especially if they're staying within the same company, that's awesome. It's like, cool. They want to try new challenges or do something different, and not to me, is exciting. And it's like, Well, great. We get to keep someone awesome. They're going to contribute in just a different way, and it keeps them engaged. So I think there's benefits to it. But yeah, you never know how your manager is going to respond. Fortunately, I felt like Netflix was always really good for that. It was like, you don't get retaliated in and like it was almost encouraged to to explore different things that even just have the conversation be like, actually, that team is not for me. And that was cool. I figured that out. Maybe you want to stay in your old team. So I think that it is good to do that. So I'm glad, I'm glad you at least reached out and had the conversation. Yeah, it worked out, because my

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
old teammates just pink me anyways, because you're still, I'm still in the same Slack. So when they when I wrote some code, they're like, What is this? I could still answer that question. So it wasn't like, a terrible, like, the knowledge transfer wasn't like, as intense, because I was like, also just DM me, like, I'm right here. Oh yeah, yeah. You can set up recurring one on ones with me. I can explain some stuff, because I'm sure it looks crazy cool, but yeah, so anyways, it was, it was a good I'm happy where I'm at, right? So I'm stoked. That's awesome.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Well, let's maybe, uh, start maybe earlier in your career. Can you share a bit about your career, what led you into the tech industry, and then, you know what? What brought you to Netflix?

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
Yeah, I have quite a long journey. I think I joined the I think I became, like a professional quote, unquote programmer, like 2009 ish, so quite, quite a ways away. I started off, like, mainly on the DoD space on the east coast. So I was doing government contracts. Government gets kind of boring after a while. I think I was like in the DOD for like almost a decade, and everyone kept talking about Silicon Valley, West Coast tech. West Coast tech is the best. And I was like, Okay, let's see what it's really about. So I ended up moving over here. Like, fast forward to 2019 I was like, Okay, I'm gonna make a jump for it. And this is before, like, remote was, like, a big deal right now. Nowadays you could, I would have stayed on the East Coast for sure, if it was like it now, but the only way for me was I would have to go to the office. So I was like, Okay, let me put myself in a position to to where there's a lot of companies that I would like to work at, which is either Los Angeles area the Bay Area. I ended up going to Los Angeles doing like a startup there. And I was like, okay, got acclimated to California, and then covid happened, like, a year later. So like, I was stuck in a shoebox with a newborn son of my wife, and they're like, Why did you help? Why did you put us in this situation? I felt so bad. But anyways, we made it through it, and everything's amazing now. But yeah, I mean, it was interesting, because going from DOD to, like startups is kind of like a culture shock. Absolutely. The people you meet, yeah, like in the DoD space, like college was like a big deal. They're like, Oh, where'd you go? I went to this ivy league school. I didn't go to Ivy League school, but all these other kids did, and they they asked me. I'm like, don't worry, you never heard of it. I was like, I would say where I went. I was like, my GPA was not good. I was like, but anyways, like, yeah, the DoD space was just like, all, like, image on paper. It was, it was interesting. But then when I went to the tech and, like, the startup I went to, there was, like, a lot of boot camp people, a lot of people from, like, non traditional backgrounds. I don't have a CS background. I have, like, an IT background, kind of or degree. But it was interesting just to see the personas, like, the difference between, I'm not saying like, they're good or bad, but the persona from, like a classical train, like CS degree person, to like this boot camp person. I don't want to like compare and contrast, but it was like, night and day one wasn't bad, one wasn't good, but it was just different. So that was like, one of the things like I had to adjust to on the west coast was everyone was like, super upbeat. Light like, Yeah, let's go happy hour. Let's go chill. And then when I was on the East Coast, everything was like, okay, clock out 5pm do your timesheet. Blah, blah, blah. After this, I ended up at Hulu, and this was, like, my first introduction to, like, entertainment business, and ultimately, how I ended up at Netflix. I never really thought about streaming. It was always just like an app on my phone or my TV. Didn't really think much about it. Never really thought that I wanted to work there. But oddly enough, I started like, doing streaming on Twitch. And a lot of like, these streamers that were popular, they all worked at Netflix. It was really weird. It's like, if you stream on Twitch, like. Somehow, like, you, like, you should work at Netflix. Yeah, yeah. So it's weird that happened to me as well. So, like, sure, you, you know, like, who the prime engine is? He's like, one of, like, the bigger streamers in the space, and one of my friends, Jordan, who was also working at Netflix at the time. I was like, I was like, Man, you guys are, like, really smart. I was like, Where do you work? Like, I work at Netflix. I was like, Oh, man. I was like, I don't think I could ever work at Netflix. You guys are, like, amazing, but yeah, the fast word things like Chris, you know, from the team. I knew him prior to Netflix, and I remember I was on the beach in Hawaii with him. He was just drinking beers. I was like, dude. I was like, Chris, you're like, insanely smart. So I get why you work in Netflix. I was like, should I just shoot my shot? And this is, I'm working out who at the time. And you know, with competitors, we're always comparing Netflix numbers to who numbers, and we'd always see, like, Netflix is like, just dominating this. And I was like, I want to see what it's like over there. We're always, always talking about their technology and how they're so fast. I was like, Well, I wonder what it's like on the inside. So it really got me thinking, especially after seeing like, Netflix engineers, quote, unquote code Live, which I thought was, like, super impressive. And then also knowing Chris, who was also a very impressive engineer, I was engineer, engineer, in my eyes. I was like, Okay, let me, let me try. And I remember, like, on my laptop, like, right after I got done drinking a bunch of beers, and I just cold applied, like, I didn't even ask for referrals. Cold applied to, like, three, and then like, two, three days I was already, like, doing like, phone interviews with him. It was super fast. Granted, this was like, the peak of tech. This is when, like, the stock price of everybody. It was just like

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
something. It was like, early covid time.

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
Was it or, yeah, it was like, potentially, like, like, you could argue it was probably easier to get into tech when it was just booming, because business is booming, right? Companies are just like, Oh, I got all this money. We need headcount, blah, blah, blah. So potentially, like, that could be a reason why I got hired, not doubting my own abilities. But, I mean, it was definitely a different time, for sure, but yeah, then I ended up here. It's funny, because now that I work, I've worked at Hulu, which is now like Hulu Disney, and that's when I left, when Disney did this full acquisition, when I moved to Netflix, like, for some reason, like, I got super interested in the entertainment business. So now I listen to podcasts about what directions is Hollywood going? What role does Tech have in Hollywood? And I'm like, really, like, super into it now. And I'm always like, looking at our numbers, and I'm like, okay, when we drop, like a title, I'm like, looking at the analytics to see, like, how we do. And I'm just like, so into it. Yeah, it's interesting. So now I'm like, full blown, like, super into like, Hollywood and, like, the stream business, and how it impacts it. And it's also interesting, because my brother's an editor in Hollywood, so he's like, he's like, seeing the impact. So when we have, like, the strikes, yes, like, it was kind of awkward for me. I was like, yeah. I was like, Netflix was like, they're doing pretty good through the strikes, like they have, like, a good game plan. But it's like, I was like, torn because, like, you know, the whole strike thing, they're all struggling, and I'm working on the other side. I almost felt like an enemy in some sense, yeah, because

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
it was, they're fighting tech essentially, like, that's part of the problem. He was like, What

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
are y'all doing over there? I was like, I don't know. And even if I did know, I don't know if I could tell you anyway. So we didn't look that good between us. It was never, like, a big deal, but always, like, in my head, I was like, oh, man, this is, like, awkward, very, very awkward. So we're I fast forwarded a lot, but no, that's good.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
There's so many cool things you said too, that I just related to, like, a lot, mainly in your like, career and just like, not having the CS background. Neither did I to have a tech degree, but it's Yeah, it wasn't the traditional CS degree. And the same thing is, yeah, like, with the entertainment point, I feel like I always really loved movies and TV shows and, like, watched a ton of Netflix before joining but I hadn't really been like, oh, yeah, I have to go work there. Like, when I, when I moved to Silicon Valley, the same idea was, like, I want to go work there. I remember feeling like a difference in culture, too, of how people worked and operated. I did a bunch of government work and things like you said they were boring. They moved slower, right? Like, not is difficult, but yeah, the entertainment business, I'm like, Yeah, I care more about it now too. I pay attention to things like, even creatively, like, how something is filmed, or, you know, just thought through in the actual it's interesting. Like, I pay attention that. Or even when I was at Netflix, I would read a lot of that, similar to you, read a lot of the analytics to, like, how did this title perform? How much did Netflix pay for it? Like, what's, you know, what's our plans with that? It was pretty cool. Like, I definitely got more into that too. So it's kind of cool that that happened to you as well. Yeah, because it

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
just interests me as like, how do we make money? Like, how much are we spending on this? And I was always, I was always confused on how Netflix made money. Outside of subscriber count, right? Right? Like, how do you rationalize making money from a title that's quote, unquote, like, if you're already a subscriber, you're not really paying extra for a new movie. So it always confused. I was, like, how do we turn that into a monetary or, like, until, like, some kind of tangible amount, right? So, like, if I was been a menu, if I was a member for one year?

Sense, obviously, everything's changing enough. Looks rapidly as and all that. But, yeah, it's just, it's interesting to me, like, how we make these numbers, like, come up with these numbers and stuff like that. Well, I want to add one other thing that kind of got me to Netflix. I remember, I've been listening to Friday night happy hour since you all started this thing, I think, which was a long, long time ago. So I'm, like, a long time listener. That's

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
awesome. I love the first time Poller. I love it, Chris, that's great. I

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
think one other thing that, like, kind of drew me to Netflix was I would always just see like public speaking, like talks or blogs from like Netflix engineering, and then they would kind of just like flutter throughout the Internet, whether I assume on Twitter, LinkedIn or shared in work slack. And I'm like, Oh, wow. Like, this is interesting, and it's cool to see, like tools that a company makes that ends up being like industry standard in some in some form, that was also like one other big thing that kind of, like, drew me to Netflix, not necessarily, like, I never really wanted to be like a fan engineer. I never really cared about that, nor do I really care about it now. But it really just comes down to, like the tech that we're putting out in, like, the culture and stuff like that. So that's always been something super appealing to me.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I mean, the culture was always appealing to me, and it kept me there for so long. But I love putting out that type of content too, right? Like, it's something that I've cared deeply about. And at my time at Netflix, I spent a lot of, like, free time thinking about, like, how can we, you know, share some of these amazing things that we're doing. And I think that is really powerful. It gets people excited to want to maybe possibly work at Netflix, but then it's also they get the opportunity to, you know, learn from some of those things. Not that Netflix has all the answers, but I think the industry, like we need to share more, because we're all doing similar things, right? Yes, Hulu and Netflix are technically competitors in the space of streaming. But, like, let's say you're just, how do you solve this problem? Like, it's like, you're gonna figure it out anyways, if you can talk together and just kind of solve the problem together, that's amazing. Or if you're talking to like, Uber Lyft. It's like, well, we're not really competitors, but this is how we solve that problem. And I love, like, being able to share that and just like, brainstorm with other engineers, which is kind of cool. Obviously, there's some secret sauce in each of the companies that you don't share, but a lot of it, I don't know, especially on the front end, it's like, you can pretty much see the code right? Like, it's, you know, there's, there's, it's not that hard to kind of pull apart, like what Netflix is doing by, you know, it, it's complicated, but you can start to pull at it if you really want to inspect the code and things like that. So I really like that about the front end community, especially,

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
yeah, one thing I do like about Netflix too is, I think, what was the thing you were hosting internally, like JS forums or something like that. Oh, yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
yeah. Like, I'd start, I've started a few things throughout the years, but there was a JavaScript forum where it was like, yeah, just like, sharing different things of what others are working on across the company. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
I've really enjoyed those. We have, like, a number of those now, just trying to everyone collaborate and see what lessons learned, and how can we actually collaborate and build tools that just, like, help not only us, but also just, know, help open source community as well. So I think those are, like, some of the things that are, like, really kind of like light my passion, or like my motivation, when I see things like that, because usually when I don't, I feel like I kind of stop learning, and you kind of feel like you're in a silo, and then you're like, Okay, maybe, maybe I either go to a different team and try to learn something new, because I already feel like I know everything on this team, you know, like, the typical stuff, yeah, the life cycle of an engineer, to be honest, at any job, 100%

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
like, I feel like being at Netflix for a long time. I moved around because of those, those challenge. I wanted new challenges. You just, you did that recently too. Like, shift to a new team. Because you're like, I kind of know the space. It's not that you hate it. You're just like, I need new challenges. And I love that. Like, I love that flexibility to be able to do that. And, yeah, being able to see what others are doing sometimes is so powerful. Like, it's even if you're not, like, I'm never going to use that technology? Or I don't know when I'm going to use that, but I think sometimes seeing someone present on a solution or a technology is so cool, because it just it gets you excited. Like, I always love conferences for that too, where it's like, it just breathes some like inspiration in you, and it's, it's really good. I i. Like everyone should try and do that more often.

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
Yeah. 100% 100% Yeah. Surrounding yourself by like motivated people as well as will only bring good benefits. And that's something I like, kind of adopt in my life, just to be around positivity and people that are motivated to like, not saying you need to like ship every minute of the day, but people that you know want to be them best selves, or be the best engineer they can be. It's crazy how much that influences your own life.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Oh, absolutely. Like, it's, I mean, you spend so much time at work, like, if you're unhappy there, it's gonna bleed over into your personal life too.

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
Yeah, exactly, 100%

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
so you were before at Hulu, and I'm curious, like, how much did that help you in your preparing for Netflix, like, two streaming services, was it like, helpful, or just completely didn't really matter?

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
I don't know how much it mattered. Like, at the end of the day, especially, like, if you're on the UI space, it's kind of like same thing, different product, almost. It did prepare me in the sense that, like, now I was familiar with, like, the entertainment industry, also just the scale, like traffic, right? Obviously, we had a good amount of traffic, I don't think anywhere near as much as Netflix, because they weren't global at the time. But it's still, like, it's a non trivial amount of traffic. So, you know, uptime is very important. And you know, making sure what you're shipping out is, like, good. So, like, you know, hardened tests, all that stuff like that. So it's almost like, I think, like, the team I was on was almost equivalent to, kind of, like, to do, like, a Netflix or something, right, kind of like a front porch, SEO, heavy, etc. So in that sense, it was, it did prepare me, but it wasn't like the first time I did those things, but it was good to just be like, familiar with industry, understand, like, oh, this movie's coming out, or this show is coming out. We need to, we need to do something. AB testing is also, like a big thing, right? Because for any platform, customer acquisition is, like, super important. So you know, you want to do AB tests. What can you do to tweak the UI to get more subscribers, stuff like that. So that was, like, pretty relevant as well. So, yeah, I think, I think, all in all, it was like a really good experience that did prepare me fairly well. But ultimately, it comes down to the engineer. It's themselves, right? Like you could be at a great company, but you know, were you doing good work? I don't know, maybe, maybe not. Do you do your best to keep up with, you know, your skills? Are they sharp, or are you working here and kind of just floating right? So it really comes down to those factors as well, but I think ultimately it did have a positive impact on my interview process and just my headspace for getting into the to the role.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's awesome. No, I love hearing that, and I'm curious too. And you mentioned, like staying up to date with tech, I think that is super important. It's It's hard too, right? Like, we have full time jobs, and it's like, how do you stay up to date? You will, you know, especially in the front end space, it's constantly changing. Some of it is things that you might just be able to ignore, but it's also hard to know what you should ignore and what you should listen to. I'm curious. Like, what are some things that you find useful for staying up to date, like you mentioned, like watching folks on Twitch, which is a cool way, like something that, not something I had done a lot of. But I'm curious, are there other ways that you stay up to date on, what's the new trends or new tech to try?

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
Yeah, I think one is conferences. For sure. I watch a lot of, like, virtual conferences. Thankfully, they're all mostly streamed nowadays. Um, so that's like, one way, and I keep up to date. Another one that's like, not so so much, but Twitter, I definitely, there's definitely a key number of people I follow that are, like, very well known in the open source space for just delivering great libraries. So I'll tend to curate lists with those people on it, and kind of just going through that list, I'll call like, open source or something, and go through and see what are, what they're talking about. And then also, I joined discord. So a lot of the products I use, I tend to have questions, and not necessarily that the docs can't answer because they're very, like, specific to what I'm doing. So I'll go into discord and I'll either search for, like, keywords for questions, or I'll ask them and be like, Okay, well, what's a good alternative, or whatever. But yeah, it also just comes to, I like to code for fun, not so much nowadays. I kind of have, like, a big burnout session not too long ago, but I tend to like build products and just try all the newest stuff and see what I'm missing. Because when, when you're at companies like Netflix or Hulu, anything, any company that has existed for more than three years or more, you're not going to be on the latest and greatest. So typically, what's going to happen, and that's one thing like a lot of people, I think, don't realize, is these companies have been around so their code base is using, you know, library versions or whatever that were from like, years ago, because refactoring is just too risky or not even worth it. So sometimes, for me, like to scratch my own itch. I have to build stuff with the modern things outside of work, because I don't get to play with those internally. That doesn't mean I ignore them completely internally. I'll do I'll pitch them, but the migration path to adopt, like delete the bleed as the leading edge or bleeding edge, ish, it takes a while, right? So that's kind of how I keep the day. You know? Building rating guys, keeping my ear to the ground for sure.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's awesome. And I love that you brought up the like, not just jumping on the latest things at work like that. Yeah, these companies aren't doing that because it's so expensive. Like, it's, it is, it's risky too, right? Like you had mentioned, like you're introducing something new to the code base, but it's expensive in the sense that it can be a distraction, or you're not getting any real value or impact out of switching to the latest version of X, Y and Z. You have to really, like, be thoughtful about when you're switching and, like, what are you actually gaining for it? And so even when you said pitching it, it's like, it probably looks like thinking through the strategic thing of like, what? What value are we going to get? What problem is this solving? And then what's the rough estimate that it'll take to actually migrate to this said technology? And then everyone should probably times that by 10, because it's always way longer than you expect.

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
Exactly I did a migration not too long ago, and Netflix is like a heavy dock first company is probably the first I've seen that had, that would had so much Google Docs. I'd ever seen so many Google docs in my life, but I was doing this migration, I made a lengthy doc, and I was like, these are the benchmarks. This is actually an improvement. You know? I measured it and then gave, like, my pros and cons of, like, developer experience. But pretty much had to, like, make a huge case to be why it would be worthwhile to put like, a full, like, roadmap, right? That's really what you have to do with these big companies. You can't just go in and say, I saw this on Twitter. It looks amazing. Let's just npm install it, and then just go with it, right? You have to be very pragmatic about how you make these decisions. And that's one thing I really like about an effort that I noticed too, at least on this team and my previous team, is we're very thorough in our investigations. We don't just throw ideas out, but like any false promises, we do our due diligence to, you know, say this is good. This is why I think it's good. I tried it here. It was actually pretty good. What do you think? And that's, I love that kind of stuff. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I'm a huge fan of that. And you're right. Netflix is, like, memo heavy, like so many Google Docs, and I'm so guilty for it too. It's ingrained in me that, like, if you came to me and you're like, Hey, Ryan, I want to introduce said technology. I'm like, great. Like, what? What does it solve? What do, you know, what's the cost of it? How's it impacting others? Write up a memo, like, Chris, go write it in a memo, you know, share it with the team. I think it's so powerful too, because you get like, you get asynchronous comments, and you get people able to, like, say, Wow, you didn't even think about X, Y and Z, Chris, and you're, like, amazing. Like, it's just making you a lot more thoughtful, really fast. And I also expect engineers at a senior level to not just be an npm install and to be a little more thoughtful. And I don't care, like, we'll make mistakes on it, but I think it's, it is so important to be, like, pragmatic on that and just thoughtful. And I think it, it makes us better engineers. Like it truly does. I think just like putting that thought that goes into it and putting it on paper, you kind of think through it, and you might even decide, wow, this is not worth it. Like, I've totally come to that decision where I'm, like, writing up a memo, and I'm like, Yeah, I'm not even gonna I don't think this is the right thing for us, and I might share it with people and with my conclusion, but it was not what I intended at the start, was like, We need this technology, and then it's like, no, it's not worth it,

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
exactly. And like, you're familiar, obviously, you're from the team I was, I am on now, so you're familiar with the code base. Like, we have this huge mono repo, and we have a good amount of engineers working on it daily. So it's like, if I want to introduce something, you know, this impacts all them too. So I also have to, like, shop it to them and be like, as a stakeholder in this code base. Like, do you like it? Like, is this something you would like like as well? So I can't just think about like, the core team that I'm on. I have to think about everybody else too, and just weigh those in, weigh their input as well. So I

the impact it has is so great. So it's definitely, like, a skill set. I felt like I was pretty good at but then once I joined this team, I was like, Okay, I actually have to, like, communicate a lot, a lot, a lot. Um, so I've been growing a lot in that space and thankful for chat, GPT for making me really good at writing docs or writing papers. I'll pretty much just, like, feed it on my bullet points, and I'm like, yeah, it could sound like five out of 10 smart, but not too smart.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Like, don't make me sound too smart,

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
exactly. Sometimes it uses big words. I'm like, I'm like, no, no. I'm like, regenerate. But now, like, I feel like I'm pretty good at, like, verbal communication, writing, not so much, but ChatGPT has made me, like, such a productive person, as far as like docs and like memos go, it's amazing.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I I love that for hearing that too is like, because writing is a hard skill, yeah, very much communication is, let's just actually start there. I think verbal and written communication. Information is something that I don't think everyone's perfect at. It's always something that I've constantly tried to be better at in you know, how do I communicate this idea quickly and concisely, but also that people understand, especially as a manager, if you're communicating something to your entire team, you don't want it to be a lot of work to read, like, 30 page memo, or you don't want it to be that, like you think one thing and the other person on the other side thinks another thing, that the words are kind of mixed up. And so I like that you're using something like chatgpt. Some people would say, oh, that's like cheating in a sense. But I don't see it that way. I see it as like, you will also learn. You'll be like, oh, you know, you're kind of seeing how the AI structures it to be, like, more concise. And you're like, oh, I can do that. It's, it's things like Grammarly has taught me even like to write better. It'll catch errors that I like. It's in my brain that I'm like, I will not screw that up again.

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
It's amazing. I'll write a sentence and I'll say, reword this. And I'm like, wow, I had no idea you could word it this way. This is so much better. So I'm like, I'm learning, like, new words and stuff too. It's like, This is amazing. So it's definitely been helping my career as far as, like, technical writing goes. And, like, it's amazing. I love it. I can't I can't think it enough to be honest. Yeah, I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
love it. It's so powerful. It's like one of those tools that you need to try. You need to try it. You need to figure out how it works for you. I think if you're not, that's the problem is, like you might not work for every use case, but like you will find use cases where it's saving you some time, or just like bringing you from zero words to something, and that you might keep that fine after so I love that. What about coding? Are you using AI in your coding?

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
A little bit. I use copilot here and there. It's funny enough, like, my copilot, like, deactivated, like, three months ago, and I didn't even notice, so I just reactivated again, and now it's actually distracting me. But yeah, copilot, I've been using that for just general, like, auto completion type stuff, not too much for Oh, actually, I'll do it the parse Docs. So I'll, like, give it, like, some docs. And I'm like, can you, like, paraphrase this for me, because sometimes they're just way too long, and I just need, like, the bullet points where I'll ask it where, if I know it's something that's been out for a while, I know that it's probably gone through them the training or whatever. So I'll just quickly ask it to be, like, here, given this code, how would you migrate to maybe using this library instead? It's not accurate most of the time, but at least, like, I'll try it and I'm like, Okay, this isn't working. Like, let me, like, dig deeper, but sometimes it's spot on. Sometimes it's very good, but it at least gets, like, my brain going, it gets me somewhere, versus, like, nothing, like, it's easy for me to look at something like, that's probably not right. Then sit there and look at literally nothing and be like, I don't even know what the wrong way looks like, probably. So it's always easy to modify versus create from scratch. So for that reason, I think it's great. But again, you have to be you have to know, like, you can't just copy and paste. You have to be pretty due diligence. It's like a code review. So, but, yeah, I use it not too, too heavy for really complex tasks. I usually ask my co workers, because a lot of the stuff I ask is very Netflix specific problems, which you won't really get on the internet. So

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, I think that's that makes a ton of sense. So we've described it because I'm like, I find that it is very helpful for certain things when you're coding and it's not perfect, some of the times, I'm like, that's, that's exactly how I would have written it. Thank you very much. You just saved me a ton of time. But I like what you said that it, it's kind of like, it starts you somewhere, right? Like, it's like, you know, it's kind of like something like create react app. It's like, you go from like, zero to at least some boilerplate to get started. And I found that AI is helpful for that too. It's like, Hey, I'm gonna need this, like, page. And it's like, oh, well, here, you know, here's a new route, here's, like, all the things, and it sets up a lot of that scaffolding for you that it just saves you time from having to do all that. But then when you start to, like, get in the nitty gritty, sometimes you're like, it's it gets you, like, 80% you need to take it to, like, that last 20% and then another one that I've been finding is errors. Like, when you have an error, oh, man, is it just helpful? Like, I don't want to read the garbage here chat GPT or here copilot. What's this error? Like? It's, it's not perfect, but it's, is super helpful to kind of get somewhere. One

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
thing I've been actually now I think about I've been abusing chat GPT for, is we have a lot of bash scripts that are, like, gnarly, and I'm not the biggest fan of bash, so I'll actually like, copy and paste the bash script, and I'm like, can you just explain to me what's happening? And like, it's been doing a super good job at it. I'm like, Okay, thank you. Like, it'll take like, a couple underline bash script and just, like, condense it down to like, a couple key points. And like, this is, like, a very important part. And I'm just like, okay, okay, I'm good. Now I understand this bash script. Now I can probably go write my own etc. So it's like, one of. Everything I've been using it for, but mainly, like, if you look at like my chat log, they all start with reword this, reword this.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, another one. I like that. You said that too. Is like bash scripts. Another is regex is a good one too. It's like you could just throw it in there. Like, what is this doing here? And it's like, it explains it really well. It is super helpful.

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
I just avoid red gets up the plague. Like, Oh, yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Fair enough, yeah. It's, I remember it early in my career having a like, I can't remember which book it was, but there was, like, a whole book on it, just because I forget what I was doing at the time. But it was like, I was using it a lot, and it's like, it's just one of those things that I don't think I ever, I know some parts of it that I can just write by hand and, you know, by memory, but that, like, most of the times I'm like, I don't, I don't remember that it's just like, a crazy mess, like, that's, that's a cool I can think of. Yeah, this has been amazing catching up, Chris, I would love to since you have, you know, had a pretty amazing career working at companies like Hulu and Netflix and, you know, working in DOJ, that's all

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
of us, right? DOJ, DOD, pretty. DOD,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
okay, same thing, all right. And what advice would you leave people like, if you were to give some inspiring advice for software engineers out there? Yeah, love to hear it. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
I mean, first, it's like insanely hard to get an engineering job nowadays. For me, what I found works is you just have to know your foundations very well. One thing I see people struggle a lot is they kind of hear about all these technologies, and they'll just scratch the surface layer, and then they'll move on to the next technology that they think is great, but then they're just basically making like a million Hello worlds with no depth at all, and or breaking or and they're not building applications to where they're actually encountering like problems at scale. So for me, it's like, you know, know your foundations Well, well, try, try to put yourself in a situation where you can build something somewhat complex. So I think one big problem I see is like people don't have the experience, right? Like, but breaking into your first tech job right now is insane. So it's like you have experience to speak to, and if you have the opportunity, obviously it's a privilege to have the time to code, you know, on the side, like, if you're looking for a job, you're probably working your butt off at another job just to stay afloat, right? So this is definitely coming from a place of privilege, but it's like, privilege, but it's like, from what I've seen, people just building constantly and just learning all those people that I've seen, I'm not saying you need to build in public, but, you know, just building and, like, understanding, like, all these, like, system design problems that you encounter, like, has helped these people get jobs. Like, amazingly, like facts, not like, like, oh, this person built this. So let's go give them a job. But like, they've built some great products that people take notice of, and they're like, Oh, I see your work. Like, we love your product. We would love to have someone of your expertise on the team. But then also, just Foundation, like, if you call yourself a web engineer, you should know the foundations pretty well. One thing that I think was really good, as I think Jem, who's also like a panelist on this, he has some really good courses on front end masters that I took that kind of just took went over, like, the general breadth of, like the full stack of, like a web developer, and that's kind of what I see in my head, like, you should know, like, all these things, like, not necessarily, like crazy deep, but, like, pretty good to where, if I ask you a question, you could, we could have, like, a good conversation about it. And I think that's like, one thing that we kind of are lacking now, especially with all the frameworks that are coming out and all this, right? Like, if, if I give you an interview and it wasn't on a framework, would you be able to just, would you, would you go to code something? Right? I know I've been part of interviews where we don't allow you to use a framework. We want you to write it in vanilla JavaScript, which could be silly. People can think of silly because it's like, well, my day job is going to be react. Why do I need to do this? But it really helps you think about these problems, like, more at a granular level. And it really, just, really, just helped your career. So to sum that all up, be very well, be very well versed in your foundations. That's just going to carry you leaps and bounds above your competition. And then just try to, like, build complex things if you have the opportunity to for sure, I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
love that. I think that's so well said. It is that fundamentals that even as, like, more and more tools like frameworks come out, AI, we just talked about, right? Like, it's like, if you don't, I can go tell, you know, some AI to go build a web app and just give it some prompts and instructions and it will build. It. Will it work perfectly? Maybe, hopefully, let's you know, we'll see. But I think it's that, it's like, it gets you so far, but you need to understand when things aren't working, or when there's you know, you need to be able to adjust something. Same thing with the frameworks. It's like, well, when the framework isn't doing what you need it to do, then what? And so I think that's where the fundamentals are. Just writing some vanilla JavaScript is important, even if it's. Pseudo code on, like a whiteboard. It's like just showing that understanding, I think, is a powerful way to interview someone too, exactly,

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
because when you build stuff and you have a question around something that's kind of similar, like, if you think about web, it's like, display a list of something, get some data, display a list of something. There's a lot of scenarios that kind of fit that mold at a foundational level. So when you get that, like in a system design question, you know, you can kind of relate to these experiences you had, like, Oh, when I was building this, I had a really hard time doing this, and then I found out it was really slow, and I did this, you can kind of just grab from your personal experience, versus trying to make up something on the fly. So I always find that if you can just pull something from pure experience, it's gonna it's so much easier to just go through an interview or answer these hard questions first trying to, like, make it up, because that's what people do. Sometimes they kind of panic. They're like, well, uh, well, maybe I'll do this. But so if you can just if you've done it before, it's like, ah, yeah, walk in the park. This is what I did, you know, and it worked.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Couldn't agree more. Well, thanks so much, Chris for joining us on front end happy hour. I love that you were a long time listener. I'm like, we should have just had you on sooner. But hey, this is great.

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
I actually can't believe I'm on this. It's fantastic. You're like, I have like, a shower speaker, and I'll just, like, blast, like front end happy hour. I'm just like, showering or like, driving somewhere, which is weird. I make a shower that I'm like, in the shower listening to you all

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
my head, my head went, was like, Chris, I'm coming in the shower with you. Like, this, some weird

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
just the way for me to, like, you know, as a parent, like, we only have so much time to be alone. There's, like, showers, like, by one time, or if I'm working or whatever. So yeah, I'm I love, I love this, this ship, this podcast, is one of my favorite ones, for sure.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Thanks so much, Chris. I love hearing that. Where can people get in touch with you? If they want to talk with you? Connect with you. Yeah, you can

</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bautista</strong><br />
find me on Twitter. My alias is trash online, so you can find me at, I think it's, I think they got rid of twitter.com I think it's just x.com now slash at trash. Dev, so trash with two H's, underscore Dev, you can find me there, or you can find me on my Twitch, which is trash, underscore Dev, as well. I don't stream as much anymore, but I'm definitely on Twitter all the time. So

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
right on Well, yes, definitely check out Chris's content. It is very good. He's He's very comical on Twitter too. I've always enjoyed it. So thank you all for listening to our episode. You can find us on Twitter, at front end. HH, on YouTube, front end. HH, really, wherever you like to listen to podcasts on you know, subscribe. Leave us a review. Let us know how we're doing.
