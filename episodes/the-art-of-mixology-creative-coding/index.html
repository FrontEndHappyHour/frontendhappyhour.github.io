<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Welcome to a brand new episode of the front end happy hour podcast. In this episode, we are getting creative with our code and talking with our very, very special guest who's been on many episodes, Shirley Wu, who's here again to join us to talk about creative code. Shirley, can you give us brief introductions of who you are, what you do, and what your favorite happy hour beverages? 

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Hi, thank you so much for having me back here again. I pretty much like beg to please, we can talk about anything I just want to hang out with you. My name is Shirley. My official title is that I've given myself is independent creator of data visualizations. I work with clients with their data to tell kind of like visual stories and but for the last year my goal has been to do more art and, and specifically to do more physical, maybe installation based art. We'll see how that goes. But yeah, so that's why I was like, please have me back on. Maybe we can talk about art and and my favorite happy hour beverage has not changed and it is whiskey of the Japanese kind,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Which we are drinking. 

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right. Well, let's also go around the table and give introduction of today's panelists. Stacey want to start it off?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Sure. I'm Stacy London, a senior front end engineer at Atlassian.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
And I'm Mars Jullian. I'm a senior software engineer at Netflix.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
I'm Augustus Yuan Software Engineer at Twitch.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And I'm Ryan Burgess, a software engineering manager at Netflix. In each episode of the front end happier podcasts. We like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all in the episode, we will all take a drink And what did we decide today's keyword is color color? We almost forgot what they keep. It's early in the Yeah, this isn't you know, it's gonna be a good episode. keyword. But yeah, if we say the word color from now on, we will take a drink. All right, I thought great way to start what art forms you like?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
So many I mean yeah, that's, that's a tough question like, so much is art like music, visual art painting digital art like there's just various like kinds of sub genres within each of those and the lie lot i i don't think that I could, I feel like I would be if I lost like certain senses like, like if I lost my vision if I lost my hearing, it'd be very upset because there's so many art forms that that I really enjoy that are that come through those senses so music through my through hearing or visual like painting and seeing That kind of thing. 

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
So yeah,lots actually on that point. Um, so I grew up, like painting and doing art for like 14 years until I was in college. And so for most of my life, I only thought of art in a very not and like narrow sense of like visual are especially like traditional fine art. And I think it wasn't until a few years ago when I was in SF MoMA, and they had that in that they had that kind of top floor with like, sound sound. 

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, which was really brilliant. 

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
And that was when I realized like, why people get so mad because like, people get emotional over art and like, it like visual art. But people get so emotional about music and sound and they didn't understand until I went to that exhibit and I realized it's because they literally moves you like it literally goes through you and like the sound waves moves through you and I thought that was really powerful. And also recently, um, I been really appreciating film and kind of like Film seven cinematography and the storytelling as an art.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, you know what I'm gonna give a plug to Stacy's pick from last episode is the Anima by Thom Yorke that film like 15 minutes of pure genius, I mean amazing music, but also it has those just visual, just beauty. I don't even it's hard to describe how amazing it is. So I think that is even just how Shirley was talking to Mike came right to mind. Yeah, the cinematography is pretty amazing. Just everything about it this memory body movement, yes. As art, like moving through space. Yeah, like totally with your body like that, in and of itself is art. I think for me, and I think of just maybe the visual aspects of art. I'm more leaning towards modern art. And then I've always been a huge fan of graffiti, street art, obviously tattoos, and then

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
photography as well. For me like this is kind of related to what Charlie said about storytelling. I have like a huge like appreciation for animation, not just in like animation of movies. They're animated like Pixar movies, but also like UX for animation like bringing like little subtle things to life. I think that is like an art form in and of itself like to take something that's very static and give it a like a little life and like stuff. And also, maybe another plug to Shirley's data visualization. I think it takes a lot of creativity to Oh, no, wait, that's not the case.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
You almost said color, I always say, cheers.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, data visualization takes incredible amount of creativity to turn data, which, if you just look at it face value, you might not really see anything, but there's a story like, like, people who do data visualization, like there's like they can tell a story like with that data, which I think is like really, really fascinating.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I think when it stands on its own, if you just look at it, you're like, Oh, this is really cool art. And then as further as you dig in, there's this layer of like, oh, there's a reason for this, the look and feel,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
yeah, like eliciting an emotional response as those as opposed to like looking at a spreadsheet of data. You're like, yep, what could be?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Mars? What would you like to add for our?

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Oh, I don't know, I feel like I was kind of struggling when you first asked the question because I was like what really, for me art is something that elicits like a very emotional response. And I think hearing you guys talk about it, it's like, they're expert like forms that are very experiential, it's about the experience of being there. And you know, kind of taking it all in like music, for example. And then there's stuff that's kind of like more static like fine art. I mean, there's an experience that is a little bit different for me, I actually really, really enjoy architecture. And that's not something that I really thought of as art for a long time and creative. So architecture and interior design, and things that are about creating spaces for people to either, you know, help them be creative, for example, like the surroundings around us, I don't think we realize have an effect on how we feel and what we do. And sometimes depending on the building, it's like it's such a large scale. To that it can be like a very Zen full moment. I mean, no, there's kind of all spectrums of the scale from going from to be very cluttered to something very minimal. But I think that's what's really cool and buildings and they're also they're a really great representation of their time, you know, you can't tear them down very easily. And so it's really some of the architecture I've experienced is like one architects like I want to do it this way. And this is the only way and that's always really interesting to see their vision come to life and you know, as they translated from paper to, you know, 3d so

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
that is really cool. I was not surprised that he picked that either.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Context both my parents were architects growing up I don't think I realized that it's like apparently in my genetic code.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I'm just about to make like really dumb joke about like, you're doing computer architecture now.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
That does actually transition into UX like to guess this is point like, we are architecting experiences architecture architecting and a different form of the verb but we are making experiences and we're we're trying to elicit responses from more users, whether they be emotional or functional. And that's what's really interesting about UX design. I think.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
So talking cleaning into the code aspect of art, which I think there is an art form in many ways around code. I'm curious, how would you define if art is generated by a computer?

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
So that's a super interesting question. Um, in the sense that I think the most straightforward answer is like computer generated art is when some part of that process of like, creating something is like you had to write code for it, or I feel like that's the simplest answer. But I actually am thinking of like, I'm really bad at names. So I can't remember the artists but the artists like of the 50s that, um, they drew things that were gorgeous because they looked like they were computer generated or machine generated, but they did it by hand. This is a little bit tangential and off topic. Um, but like, I think it's such an interesting kind of like loop like because And there are now I see friends that do generative art that aren't inspired by those artists that kind of did. Those are pieces that look like computer generate, like, you know, they're like grids of like, like really, really straight lines. And they're grids or, or there's like certain patterns that look like you might have coded them, but they did them before computers were like a, like a commonplace thing. And I now have friends that are inspired by those artworks I'm and trying to generate them digitally or by computer.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's really cool. And I'm curious too, is like makes me think like that you said code that there's some form of code. But then as you were talking, I'm like, Well, some of this could be done through illustrator Photoshop. And is that computer generated art?

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I actually would argue that like when I think of computer generated art, I think there's two things there's like one what Shirley said which is like I think computer assisted art like it's it's a creative idea that you use digital tools to produce And then I guess the most obvious thing for me that comes to my music computer generated artists sort of like all this AI art that's been that's been happening now, like jet like generating art based on like previous examples as opposed to, hey, I have an idea I need to use a computer to do this, like fractal art, for example is not as computer generated, but it's more of the, the idea behind what ends up being the art at the end is still comes from a human. I don't know, that's the separation in my mind. Whereas the AI generated the idea the final idea is kind of comes from computer in a sense,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
yeah, I actually kind of made that distinction that mark Mars you mentioned, like, it's, it's pretty interesting because when I think of computer generated art, I sometimes maybe it's because I work at Twitch. Now. I don't know I think of how some games there's this concept of procedurally generated levels. So that's like kind of becoming a more popular thing. There is a game that kind of failed, but it's okay. It's kind of a meme now. But like one big thing was it's a game called No Man's Sky. And a huge selling point of it is you would never To these worlds, and the worlds are totally procedurally generated, so as you go through the world, it just gets generated like that. And it's like kind of die. It's dynamically generated by the AI or computer or whatever it like helps because it's like, you don't have to save like these pre generated levels. Like, you're just, it's like a different experience for it'd be like many, many permutations. Yes, I have. I'm not qualified to like, like, I don't even know how it works. But yeah, so so that's what I think of, but it's a very interesting, interesting topic.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
And I want to point out that like games are art to games are beautiful pieces. Well, the well done ones.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the generated stuff is interesting. I think when I thought of that phrase, it makes me think of, I think what kind of a few of you have mentioned already where there's the human aspect of, maybe you write some code or you write a function or you write and even an algorithm to do something that may be the generation part is like the unexpected piece of it. Like, I like that you wrote the code intentionally and an output of visual design. But maybe there's like the unintended consequence of like a bug you wrote, but it turned out beautiful.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
So I actually make a distinction between generative art and data driven art in the sense that in my mind, I, like I know of a lot of people that call themselves generative artists and that they've, their art is driven by randomness, or by Yes, yeah. Um, and so that part is the kind of like the serendipity of whatever the machine gives you. Whereas, like, data driven art is, is kind of I do more data driven art. And that's like, you get a data set and you like, you know, map certain parameters to certain like aesthetics. And I'm gonna say color right now, because we haven't. I just realized from this conversation, I have a very narrow definition of computer generated art because in my head, it's just the generative art. The has the randomness, but I actually wanted to ask a question, because I think there was a few months ago where there was an auction. And it was a and it was the first piece of art that got sold that was generated by

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
deep learning.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Yeah, it was 100% ai driven that like somebody had, I'm taking the open source code and then they had generated this thing completely. And then it's sold for like, what a quarter million or

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
$432,500. You

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
know, that meme? That meme? Like do not want and it's like, I'm back in the chair. That's what I just did. When I saw it. I

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
looked it up and my first reaction was that is terrifying. And it's like something out of my dream.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
But it's sold for that much because, yeah, because it was the first piece like it's the first ever like on human non human art that got put for auction and I just wanted to like ask about your opinions of like, does that qualify as art for you because I have a certain opinion

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think it does in the sense specially when we got back to the defining computer generated art is, I mean, someone had to program it. So the whole point of AI is it starts to take mine of its own, I guess, in a sense, but it, I would think it's art, it's generated from it. And then going back to your point of the randomization side of things, I think that to me is always stood out as one where I think balances the input of a artist, because there is someone thinking about what's the color, chairs, chairs, they're thinking of these various inputs that go into what the output may look like, even if it's a bit randomized, whether it be size shapes, what I just mentioned the keyword, you know, it's like you put in all these factors that and then have some sort of code that spits it out on the canvas or whatever you're building this on. I think of someone like Joshua Davis, his work is very, very on key on this for the sense that he codes certain things and then inputs, a lot of data Like what colors and shapes etc. Cheers was trying to avoid it. There's an artist behind it. But there's also a computer generated versus the I drew this in Illustrator, I guess that's computer generated, essentially. But it feels a little less relying on the computer to generate the final

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
thing this is this part of it is really interesting because like if we take the computer generated art and we spit out what is the first actionable AI generated piece of art? What it seems to me is like in other forms of art that we've talked about, like music and architecture and games and stuff, there's a kind of a step of refinement after what the computer creates. And I don't know if here there is a step of refinement after the AI part. And I wonder like, at what part should the human be involved and where do you lose the creativity part of the humans involved only at the beginning, and maybe that's like to Shirley's question. Like is it still art if what ended there's no human Your refinement after what the computer gave you. I'm curious, I'd be curious to know, I think

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
it goes back to those I think if you heavily have this input into it, and then you're relying on the output, I think that's okay. But there's some creativity going into the input that basically helps generate what's coming out of it. I think that's okay. But I'm curious, whatever else things. I mean, this is very This is like a more of like, a philosophical question of like, what is art?

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, I was just gonna say that. Yeah, it's like, like, what do you define it?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
As if you were not told that this was a computer that did this? You just saw it in a gallery? You would think that it's art, you'd be like, Oh, that's nice. That's a terrifying painting.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
We should we should describe this for people because I saw that it'd be like WTF so

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
i don't i don't know if this is the right description, because it doesn't look anything like what I'm picturing, but it reminds me of the Slender Man.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Oh, okay. Um, that looks like I couldn't really see it from where I am, but I am not looking.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I guess it's not this doesn't look anything Like what the Slender Man care. It's a bit like, the aesthetic of the painting reminds me of that, like terrifying game wasn't a game. It was a game. Yeah, yeah. So um, yeah, I don't like it.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
But it listed in a very strong emotional response from all of us.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You know it isn't that what are supposed to do? Love it or hate it, you got a reaction that could be

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
can make you comfortable or

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
uncomfortable. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
And as you know, at the end of the day, it is eliciting conversation.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, that's true.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
So is it art?

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I'm gonna have to go?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yes. I think so

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
what most of us accept as the definition of art. I think that is art in the sense that I'm, like, you know, that's based off of like, whatever, thousands or hundreds of thousands of, you know, actual art. And that was kind of like what you've learned on and that's what it generated, in the sense like, I think that's actually quite poetic. Because like for thousands of years are an artists are like a lot of artists are actually like mimicking others or means spired by others or taking in what others have done. And in that sense the machine has taken in what others have done it just that you know what other humans have done and I'm sure is sometime soon to be what other machines have done. And in some ways, there's like a good parallel there. Personally, maybe maybe I'm just like, I'm concerned for my own survival as a wannabe artist, but personally, I don't like that as art because I think, to me, my personal definition of art is that I think like what Maher said, um, that there's a human touch to it, like what Ryan said, like there is somewhere along the way that a person like this is theirs, and it's that they decided what the inputs are they decided on what refinements and it should be like that the machine is just the tool to get to help with the creativity. Whereas I think with that piece it was that like somebody literally just like, like, got the code and ran it and then generated something like there was no not like, I might, I might not be speaking the truth, but like, that was my understanding for that piece. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I think it's like missing that little bit of a human factor that goes on to it. Okay,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
that's fair, or even what we were talking about before like, some art has a story behind it. There's some storytelling factor. Yeah, the story

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
is a computer generated,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
ah, color. Because the computer said so. 

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
We've also talked about software and computer. I think of some of the software obviously, like Adobe Creative Suite comes to mind is really helps artists create artwork on the computer, but I'm also curious, there's a lot of amazing libraries out there for jobs. descript even like we talked a lot about JavaScript on this podcast, but there's a lot of great libraries that really can help with data visualization with everything that aren't related. And I'm curious, what kind of tools do you guys come across that are helpful or even find interesting that you would want to be leveraging in something you're creating for an artwork piece, one of the things that first excited me about the web and the possibilities of doing artwork in it was flash like way back. And that That to me was like it opened up this amazing door to like,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
drawing all sorts of very complicated things or animating things that that was quite difficult without it and that was like a, an early tool that was that really opened up creativity on the web, and like you saw this huge explosion of

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
beautiful artwork being put out with it. I started out doing a lot of flash and a lot of it was because I came at it from thinking I wanted to do more design, but then when I started applying code. That's what really was mind blowing here is I can actually get things to move and do animate just by writing code not having to like go in there with tweaking on the timeline and everything. So I agree with you, Stacey flashes a pretty cool tool, maybe not as much now,

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
no, yeah, definitely a more of like a historical marker of or what I see presently, I think a lot of it's interesting, because I feel like there are JavaScript libraries that are for designers and artists. And then there's like, our libraries that help you make art for software developers, if that makes sense.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
No, I think there's the plug and play a little bit easier. This is a library that you still have to do a lot of input encoding behind the scenes to actually get it to work.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Yes. So I think one of the ones I hear the most often for like when artists or designers want to get into coding is like the one that gets recommended the most is processing. And then the JavaScript equivalent of that is p five js, and which is actually quite exciting because I feel like there That foundation is kind of expanding on that like processing p five js. And they now have I think, ml five j. s. Yeah, yeah. Which is their whole goal is to make machine learning more accessible to artists. I think that's so cool.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, and p five is really cool. I have played with it a few times. I don't know if I've done anything groundbreaking with it, but I was really impressed with it. You can build things really fast with it,

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
it makes like it makes generative art so I've never really played with it, but I have a lot of friends that use it a lot. And my impression of it is that it makes um Gen one generative art really easy and second, like animation, really easy to like, basically animated generated art. And so processing and then personally, the thing I use the most before getting to this point, it was like d3. But it's not necessarily that d3 helped me Art d3 just helped me like calculate all of like all of that gnarly like things for David But I think it's I, we don't even need to talk about JavaScript libraries. I think the web itself is so like, you don't need JavaScript for SVG, you don't just know you can just make SVG shapes and you can like make smiley faces, you can make art with just SVG. And so just understanding SVG, I think is so powerful to making on the web. And then there's Canvas, which you do need JavaScript for, but it's just vanilla JavaScript. And then recently, I've been getting more and more into 3ds and Web GL, and because it just allows me so much more power, um, in terms of like, how to color 

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
that one was on the avoidable

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
interest. Like I think it's helped me make things that I've always wanted to make in the web possible that I didn't know I could do. And I was wanting to like, make watercolor sort of effects in the web, and I didn't know that was possible. Until I found Web GL shaders. So that's the thing that I'm most excited about

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
recently. Web GL shaders are really cool. It's not something I've done a lot with I've just seen some impressive work done with the show so powerful.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah. Describe describe a shader like what does that

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think it will surely even saying like the watercolors it would be literally it looks like it was done in watercolor, it just adds that texture, taking a color and I feel like a watercolor. Cheers. So

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
kind of to add on to that. I think the thing that I'm really excited about is, um, the mental shift that happened when I went from kind of like SVG to Web GL is that with SVG, and when you create a shape the way that you fill it, and is you usually can, and the easiest way to fill it is just by a color, right? You color the whole shape and maybe cheers, cheers.

</p>
<p><strong>All</strong><br />
Cheers. Cheers.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Hundreds of chairs

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
read a pattern now I'm just going to be like really confident I can create a pattern and fill that whole shape with it. And the the mental shifts that happened when I started learning web geo is that the way I can think about it is I create an object or a shape. Um, and instead of having to, instead of only being able to fill that shape with just one color I have access to I know I'm just like trying so hard. Instead of have only having access to that whole shape, you have access to I think of it as like pixels. So like if you have like, you know, a 10 by 10, and object or square or something, you have access to every single pixel because Web GL uses the GPU. And so you can calculate pixel by pixel, what that fill should be. Um, and so you can make effects later. gradients and that's how you can make affects like watercolor because, um, it's, it's you calculate pixel by pixel and you can use things like noise and I'm rambling. No,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
no, this is fascinating.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Perlin noise is another one that always comes to mind when

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think this is fascinating because like a lot of times our creativity is limited by the tools we know exists.

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah, if you don't even know if you can do something like what you're saying you have access to all of the pixels, it wouldn't even occur to you to try it blew my mind when I sued. I first decided I wanted to try three JS was because I have made it a goal to do I wanted to do a physical installation and I kind of want to touch back on the architecture part a little bit because I'm, I totally agree with you about like a spaces having character and and being able to immerse in a space that makes you feel a certain way. But I'm so I started doing three GS because I wanted to be able to think in the third dimension What I didn't expect and like what blew my mind was realizing that not only do I get to think in 3d more, and I can actually think about an object pixel by pixel and filling in pixel by pixel, and I can make the effects that I've always wanted to on the web, because I grew up doing watercolour painting very cool constraints in the medium. That's that's a really good point. Like if you're limited then it's sort of like with any art form, there are constraints within each medium. And so by pushing it and then opening doors to like, the thing that takes the constraint away, and then like what what creativity does that expand upon I want to add one more thing to that about constraints, which is, um, I met an artist who linked me to this article, and again, I'm horrible with names but some famous person once said about, like computer like AI, um, and are like, you know whether art will be taken over by an AI and whether you know there will be no more artists all of that existential crap and from the horse's mouth but I thought I thought that person has such a beautiful answer to that which is that um we as human beings our emotions are fuel emotional ball art or inspired by our or are moved by art because we know that it's human beings on the other side pushing constraints that they are the most beautiful art we come across is that somebody in artists that human artist pushed past a boundary that we previously thought nobody can push past and went beyond that and created something and so they broke through that constraint. And I thought that was a really beautiful that's an automatic Yeah, that's another I don't want computer is taking over my future.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
So you don't want a movie like Terminator but where they make

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean I'd rather that I mean come on that's a lot better than the alternative in that scenario

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
over my job just not my life

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
starts going to museums and like

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I would pay to see that

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
that's what artists fear

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I guess on that note, especially surely doing a lot of art what kind of advice would you give other engineers or artists that are wanting to do something with computer to make it computer art

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
play, right? Like that's, that's that was the beginning of the web for me play. I didn't necessarily even know what I was doing. I didn't have any I didn't take a class. I was just like, what does this do? What does this do what if I apply this CSS property?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
What does that assess was a fun one to play with?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah. And you got all these like unexpected results sometimes expected, sometimes unexpected and that was like the beauty and super It was so fun, and I loved it. And that's what really like inspired me to keep going and I think that's that's like a huge I guess piece of advice is just like, just jump in and play.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, especially for like Web GL in three Gs. I also played around with it. And I will say the learning curve is like pretty high. But there are a lot of tools now actually three js. There's this was a pic a few episodes ago, three JS has an editor that's like kind of a GUI called three js.org slash editor. And it's a it's really, it's incredible. It's basically if you're familiar with blender or those 3d tools, you can essentially create it with your mouse very easily. And it's a progressive web app. Crazy. So

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
cool.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
That is actually like it's mind blowing that they created that so

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
well. This may not be advice from someone who does a lot of generative art, but I think that one of the things that for me is always super intimidating is just like a lot of the stuff that I love and appreciate is always the finished product and never realizing that there's a whole process behind that. And for me like to go back to Jason's point like play. They didn't get there overnight. Yeah, that's all you're seeing. And I just constantly have to remind myself it's like, either when creating something that I consider to be art or even just starting on a new project, like there's a there is a learning curve, but you have to enjoy that in addition to like, what is it the end and sort of just remembering that there's a lot that goes into what you end up seeing on the on the, you know, physical or digital canvas and that's my advice to myself and everybody else to

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
10,000 hours thing is people that you see that are amazing didn't get there with like,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
practice bridge like Yes, yeah, you're you're you're looking at their artwork being like, Damn, they're amazing. It's like, Yeah, but there's also a lot of work to get to that point.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, my friend, my friend Stephens, amazing artists and, but he draws every single day non stop at all times. Like he'll just be hanging out with you and just be like, sketching on the side. Like, always practicing always trying to get

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
better. So one of my teachers in school actually just like totally reminded me stay Are you saying that he used to draw for DC comment, he would wake up every morning at 4am and draw for a few hours just every single day. And he was amazing. he mastered the skill, like he definitely did. But he didn't stop it was like he just kept going. And this is like he's probably to this day still waking up at 4am. And that's his routine of like, constantly doing this, which is like super, super impressive. Same thing for the one tattoo artist that's doing a lot of work on on me right now. He wakes up every morning at 5am and draws and plans out what he's working on and things like that. And I think to me, maybe it is just that grit to continue going and trying new things. And knowing that yeah, it's not always perfect because you will continue to learn and grow from it.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I'm gonna, I'm just gonna say as a late night person, and that the hopefully the 4am the 5am part. Yeah, these are

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
not the advice it's like, like, Yeah, no, no, but it could be also on the And like these two examples, they they're gonna be crashing early. Because what works best for them. I think they've obviously found that early morning works best for them. And to be honest, I think I used to be the late night person. Now I find I'm actually more productive early in the morning. So I think that may change over time, but knowing when you're most productive, that's a good time to do it. Or most creative to Yeah, it might be over a bottle of whiskey that might help. I mean, it could really help and that's okay. And

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
I'm really glad that Mars went first because then I'm I was because because that now I know what to say. Which is, which is that like, I think you're absolutely right in the sense that like, it's so helpful. I really enjoy those accounts that like post their daily sketches or daily doodles, I've been like, following some Instagram accounts or like daily Web GL shaders. And you can just see that it's just like tiny bite sized pieces of them like practicing their craft. And this is just like you said, like, this is almost a vise for myself, because I Been like going through a lot of insecurity in the sense that like, I think when I grew up doing art, I did that almost every day. And so I like had a certain amount of technical skill. And then when I went for like eight or nine years, not painting and not drawing on the daily, I lost it all. And, um, and then when I every time I tried to get back into it, and it was just faster to code than it was to draw like, it was so much more satisfying to just code than it was to draw. And for a while, I thought it was just that I now suck at drawing or I now soccer painting, but it's really just that I lost that daily practice. And now my daily practice is just a coating that I have to continuously remind myself because I'm just sometimes just so hard on myself to be like, whatever it like, and probably because of what we see every day of like the finished product. I'm like if my first attempt doesn't look like a finished product, I'm a failure. What I'm trying to remind myself of this last year of trying to do more art is that the beauty about art is that there shouldn't be an expectation that there's so I think of like data visualization versus data art as data visualization is that it's you need to deliver something that like, is accurate that like, you know, people are going to be able to get insights from it and that's actionable and so if you're inaccurate that's misleading and that's not something you can do but what data are it's it just needs to be pretty it just needs to make you happy like you just do whatever makes you happy. Like or if you want art that makes you miserable. Like sure like do that too. But like

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
maybe that makes that person happy. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
But it's like there's there's not supposed to be any like what art should be. Do you do whatever makes you happy? You do you? You do?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I think that's some good advice.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Color.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right at the end of each episode, we like to share pics of things. We found interesting and would like to share with our listeners. Stacey, you want to start it off?

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yes. All right, so I have I have three picks. Hopefully this isn't too many I've never done three before. Right I was so inspired by

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
you know what actually last episode I counted three for you just because you talked about the album of Anima and then also the film and as like that's two different takes. And two very good pick.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
And I'm also shockingly not doing a music pick this Whoa, I think that might be

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
coloring.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Alright, so first pick is an artist called Simon Stalin hog. Hopefully I'm pronouncing this right. It's a Swedish artist. He does digital paintings focused on stereotypical Swedish countryside environments, but then it combines Neo futuristic, sort of like sci fi stuff into it very fascinating. And he uses a Wacom tablet and he tries to emulate kind of real brushstrokes. As he as much as he can to give the human element or make it feel like it has a human element, his stuff is is fantastic. I get a lot of my wallpapers for my work computer or that. My second pick is you mentioned Jeff, Joshua Davis earlier. Yes. So that's my my second pick. So in the late 90s, early 2000s, I came across a site called once upon a forest Oh, so good. And he is by an artist called Naruto, which was basically like his pseudonym or whatever that he was going by. But it was built in Flash is incredibly innovative at the time that blew my mind. And it was generative art. So he wrote a lot of the See, I'll read this actually, because if you right click View Source, it says I program the brushes, the paints, the strokes, the rules and the boundaries. However, it is the machine that creates the compositions, the programs draw themselves. I'm in a constant state of surprise and discovery because the program may structure compositions and I may never have thought of two extra Execute, or might take me hours to create manually, which I thought was really fascinating. So check that out. It's kind of like a historical marker of like, art on the web. And then pick three is Jen Schiffer. Um, you might know her just from kind of some of her really funny medium blog posts about tech. She, she is works at glitch doing a lot of cool stuff there. But she makes pixel art. And she's got a whole site that she created called make eight bit art.com, which is really fun. So she does a lot of really cool stuff. And I like that it's just art and code kind of combined.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
You can literally color in the individual pixels.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Wow,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
that's pretty cool. Cheers. All right, Mara is already out for us.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Oh man I have to one is an oldie but a goodie. A single Dave. We were talking earlier about sort of different tools that exist on the web, that are allow for creativity. I think CSS is actually a really powerful one these days with some of the like new language features. So that's a really good site. For anyone who hasn't heard of it before. It's just, you know, they take eight, literally a single div, and then they program all of these cool little illustrations, purely ncss. My second one is actually it's somewhat relevant to the conversation and it's more like raising awareness for other people out there who might have this it's called a Fantasia. And I want to bring it up because I just found out I had this I didn't even know it was a condition, but I always thought it limited my creativity. And it's basically when your mind's eye is blind, and so you're unable to voluntarily visualize imagery. And for a lot of times, I always think that art you know, you have an idea in your head, you have a picture in your head, and you can put that to some sort of physical form and without the ability to create that picture. How do you create and I think that's actually really fascinating. Now that I know that this is a personal thing. mentation as well as like a limitation for other people out there. So that's always a really interesting conversation like how do you create when you can't see anything or create in your mind first and then put it to, you know, metaphorical paper,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
if you research other like full time artists that actually have this but still are able to output.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I haven't really yet this is so new. This is like when I found this I thought it was mind blowing. I was like, this is a thing. No wonder when you meditate, people tell you to visualize a beach. I'm like, I just can't.

What do you want for me

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
to meditate it?

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Well, I mean, that was one of the most frustrating context I've encountered it in as well as other parts of my life. But knowing knowing that it's there is really interesting and to begin to talk to people who also have it and like, how do you compensate for it in different ways in your life and programming and stuff like that? Anyway, so just bringing it up and get the news out. There's like, Oh, yeah, I don't have a mind. Starting to pay attention to that type of stuff.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Surely, what do you have for us?

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
Yeah, so um, I think I always bring three because I just don't get to be on here that much. So I'm like,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
like I loaded them all up,

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
take all my rights. Um, so the very first one I have is actually, and I cheat because I think my second one is like three different people. So I'm

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
good, you

know. And so my first is a Tokyo based, I don't even know what they call themselves, but I'm a creative agency, I don't know. And they're called team lab. I think they're pretty internationally recognized now. But um, how do you even describe them? There are a lot of their work is kind of like installations, immersive interactive installations. And so this goes back a little bit to what Mark was talking about, about architecture and, and, and they're, they're the reason why I became so enthralled with physical installations. And, but they have this particular piece they have a lot of different exhibits. installations, but they have this particular piece called crystal universe. Um, and if I break it down in the driest technological way is that it's strings and strings, like vertical strings of LCDs. And, and they're all programs such that they look like stars in the universe. Um, and it's this room that you walk into, and when you're in the middle of it, um, you can pull up their website and they have all of these quote unquote different like, six or seven quote unquote different universes that you can like, click and swipe up. And that generates a bunch of different patterns. And and if you feel like you're in the middle of space, and there's these lights going off around you, it was I think that was a moment that was like, I didn't know that human creativity could be so like it that you know, took you to the place yeah. And then it was so funny because I went back there with naughty and nobody around us realized that there was like this, this like UI that you can like control the lights and the patterns. And so we're like standing in the middle just like controlling it. And then like every time we like put something up new everybody else around this was like, whoa.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
And it was like oh my God, if I ever believed in a divine individual this would be what they feel like.

That's my first rank. I know that they had a temporary exhibit in the pace gallery in Palo Alto like a few years ago. And but they have like a few different permanent exhibits as well as like a few really incredible temporary ones Um, there's two in Tokyo right now until the Tokyo Olympics I'm and if you ever are in a you know, city that has their exhibit, I highly it was mind blowing and life changing and like, I I just want to go and do what they do now. And because I feel like their work just like, not only is it something, it's so powerful to have an artwork immerse you, but also bring people together in this, like shared joy. That was a really long first big. And the second pick is a, a bunch of people, and that really inspired me, um, in terms of creative code. And the first person is, um, her name is Misaki Nakano, um, and she's at MIAKI underscore mo FAQ on Twitter. And, and she doesn't post that often but whenever she does, like, it always just blows my mind. Um, and it's it's she does primarily web geo and she's she is she's part of the reason why I got into web SEO because I was like, Oh, I didn't know you could do like All of that. And now that I like understand a little bit about the UI JSON Web Geodon, like still, like it's still blows my mind what she does. So she's my first person pick. And second person is Matt de Laurier. is I think her his last name. And his handle is I think at Matt underscore d s l on Twitter. And he is another like incredible generative artists Web GL, like super inspiring. And the final person is Tyler Hobbs. And I think his most most of his work is over on Instagram, and he's just another brilliant, generous artist that I get a lot of inspiration from. Okay, now my third and

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
final pick your 17th pick.

I just, I don't know when you're gonna invite me back. I don't know why they can come back here. So I'm just cramming it all in and final pick I'm Matt's front end masters workshop on Creative coding. And basically, I learned everything I'm like, I learned everything to start for three, js and WebGL. From that, and then after that, it was just I think, a lot of googling, but I think it's set me up really well and to learn because because like, like Augustus said, like, there's a certain amount of learning curve for three GS and Web GL. And it's like a little bit of a mind shift from like our day to day for encoding, and I think Matt did quite a good job of setting us up and introducing us to that. So that's my 17 things.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Only like five

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
every pick was colorful.

</p>
<p><strong>All</strong><br />
Cheers,

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Augustus where do you have for us? Great question. Yeah, I have two picks. One is, um, somebody named bees and bombs. I believe His name is Dave. He has a Twitter account and he also posts like, he's like cute gifts of like, when I think of generative art, I think I just immediately thought of him. So think just check it out. These are oddly satisfying. Yeah, very satisfying and mesmerizing, is how I would describe it,

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
like perfect loops.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Although they're also cool when you can get the perfect Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
loops. Those make me very happy.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah. And then my second pick is this framework library called z dog, which, and the website is zzz dot dog. And I was like, wow, this is this is like a really gimmicky framework. What is it and it's actually like a 3d library, but they use SVG and canvas. And so I kind of was looking for 3d libraries, and I landed on three j s, but I was looking for more and this one came up, and it's a lot simpler. So if you just needed to do very simple 3d art, I think this is like a pretty good candidate. So maybe check it really

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
quick. The cool name like that. To try it it's

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
so love that some of the examples are at zzz dot dog.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, like literally that's the one site.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
That's one of their websites. Great. Yeah. And

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
also, I'm just like looking at this. I'm like, why do I do what I do? Why can't I? Why don't I just go into Ruby? Or Ruby? All right.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I have I don't even know how many pics I have. I feel like I need to have more. 1171 was definitely stolen by Stacy since I Oh, it's okay. Because I was thinking for this episode. Joshua Davis just always comes to mind when I think of computer generated art, but I'll let Stacy at that one. You should definitely go check out his artwork. And then I thought of Hey, while we're also drinking some good whiskey, it's a good pick for some creative juices. generate ideas generate some nice ideas. We're drinking Japanese whiskey, the Nika cafe green whiskey. It's really delicious. So I'm gonna take that as one of my picks. It's one of my favorite Japanese whiskies. And then there's an app if you're Giving a conference talk or giving any sort of talk where you want to avoid the arms, the oz the filler words, there's an app called like so. And it's a good way to practice you actually record yourself as you're talking. And it will count your filler words and let you know of all it's, it's sucks in the sense that you will you get that feedback, but it also really can help because it like helps identify these for you, which partly getting better at is just being more aware of your filler words. So definitely recommend that one if you're wanting to avoid those damn, arms and ahhs. So before we end the episode, I want to thank Shirley for joining us it is always a pleasure to have you back. I look forward to the stream of pics that you will save up for the next episode. So that will be really good all the more reason to have you back.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
It's positively correlated to how long it takes for you to invite me back

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right, all right. So if it's a really long time it might be 17 picks Yeah, okay.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
You invite me back next month it will just be like

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
one or two. Okay? Yeah. Where can people get in touch with you

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
first thank you so much again for having me back it's always super fun I've been looking forward to this I've been counting down the days

I have and and retain

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Are we paying you to say that?

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
yeah and whiskey oh and whiskey. But if you want to put like some some like you know, like, well, I guess we don't use cash these days. So if you want to use that

no cash and

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
digital how

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Bitcoin Bitcoin

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I pay you when a computer generated artwork that cost $430,000 Oh, yeah, you

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
can afford that

Unknown Speaker  
Mars. Yeah, no, but

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
yeah, it's always such a good time. So all of my handles on the web are at <a href="https://twitter.com/SxyWu">@SxyWu</a> on Twitter. My personal website.com Instagram. I used to have a Twitch and YouTube used to I'm thinking about bringing it back. I keep telling myself, I'll bring it back. It's fun to live code, but also life is just really hectic. That's fair. Yeah, I can't type when it's live. Oh, yeah, stressful. Yes. I need to get over that in like 30 minutes though. Good.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Drink some whiskey, I'll be okay.

</p>
<p><strong>Shirley Wu</strong><br />
The first one that had a beer and then that was not a good

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
not a good choice.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
And that gets from truly.
