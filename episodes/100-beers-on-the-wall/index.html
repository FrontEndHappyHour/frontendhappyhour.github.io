  Welcome to the episode 100 of the front end happy hour podcast. This is a huge milestone. I'm actually really impressed that we've made it and been able to put out 100 episodes. I want to start the episode by actually thanking all of you the panelists for being part of it all. It's been tons of fun, and I'm really impressed that you've all stuck with it. So I want to thank you all for for doing it,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  too. I'm impressed to hear well.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Are you impressed with yourself? Brian?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, mostly. All hundred. I've been all on all hundred episodes in spirit you have man.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  I also want to thank all our listeners. It's been amazing. having so many people listen to us have drinks and talking about software engineering topics. It's pretty cool. We've received a ton of encouraging messages over the years from listeners that we've helped them from them listening to episodes. So I think that definitely, for me has been always really inspiring. keep creating new content. So thank you all to our listeners. All right, well, let's start off by giving introduction of today's panelists. We have all of us here. Who wants to start Mars?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  I'm Mars Julian. I'm a senior software engineer in the Bay Area. And all thoughts are my own and Stacy.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  I'm Stacy London. I'm a senior front end engineer at Atlassian and all my thoughts are Mars's.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Derek. 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  I'm Derek showers. I'm a senior software engineer at LinkedIn for the past year now in New York City. And yeah, my thoughts are, I guess mine.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Brian, my name is Brian Holt. I'm a Senior Program Manager Microsoft, and all my thoughts are definitely still Steve bombers. Ryan
  
  Ryan Anklam  
  Hi, I'm Ryan Anklam. I'm a senior software engineer at Netflix and all my thoughts are with everyone quarantined staying at home worried about the Coronavirus right now 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  My name is </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />and I'm a software engineer at Twitch. And yeah, I have thoughts. That's, that's it though
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Jem Young senior software engineer at Netflix. I don't really have anything clever to say about thoughts. Oh, wait, my thoughts got to me because I'm almost out of Lacroix. So
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  that's not stress.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  And I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix. And actually all my thoughts today are on this episode. In each episode of the front end, happy hour podcast we like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all, we will all take a drink and what do we decide for today's episode is our keyword on hi Hundred on hundreds suite. So if we all say that word 100, we will all take a drink. All right, so I figured to start this episode, it'd be really interesting to just really focus on talking about the history and background of the front end happier podcast and really talk through some of the various episodes we've done and highlight some of your favorites. But I figured starting with a bit of the history might be the best way to start. So the podcasts was something I'd always wanted to do. I thought it'd be fun to just do a podcast found we're often do these types of conversations over drinks or just for fun anyways, so why not just hit record? The part about drinking came in pretty natural having drinks around these conversations. But Brian and I were talking on a shuttle ride back from Netflix to San Francisco one day, and he brought up drunk history. I'd never seen never seen the show, but I mean, I have sinned. And had suggested, well, why don't we do that we get really, really drunk and talk about front end
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  drunk JavaScript that was like, it was like, I think that was
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  that was when it came to it. And we did figure that we're like, well, that might be really hard to be on the technical side being super drunk. And that's
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  all remotely right. Like, I don't be that drunk. If you ever watch drunk history, they're extremely drunk,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  right? Like they they get drunk, then talk about the history. So we were like, Well, why don't we just sit around and have drinks while we do the podcast. And so that's where the happy hour came in. And then Luckily, enough front end Happy hour.com is available. So there's there's the story, but then we needed panelists, and so that's where everyone came on here. And I'd be interested, what made all of you want to join the podcast?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  Who was the third or the next person
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  I would say the original people that join we're Augustus gem and Ryan and Brian, you and Mars joined later, actually. Sir and Sarah and Derek joined first to actually that's that's true.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, Derek was first
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  and yes, Sarah joined Sarah was original to write. Yep. On the first episode. Yeah.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Shout out to Sarah. Pour one out for
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Yeah. All the way in Australia,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  Sydney, I guess I guess.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  Well, one, I missed Ryan, because, you know, Ryan used to be my manager, but actually also, in, you know, I remember when Ryan, when you were at Evernote, we used to do these kind of things, but not as a podcast, we would have like a Friday, weekly front end tool, meeting sync. I don't even remember the meeting name, but it was just like with like, engineers or front end and yeah, it was just, yeah, it was all the engineers who did a lot of front end we would just talk about, like all the new tools that were coming out. So like when react was coming out when node came out and stuff like that. So I thought I was like, that was like super fun. That was like, the time where I felt I was learning a lot and so I was excited to hear the podcasts was coming out for it so well I think
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  AWS honestly, who knows At Evernote, I mentioned that would be kind of fun to do is yes to think that's where I originally was like, that'd be fun to do. I had no idea how to do it. But I thought it was an idea.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  I guess like I remember we were talking about I think over drinks somewhere.
  
  And I was I was wondering, yeah, right. Yeah. And I'd always wanted to do a podcast. So I was like, in immediately. And, you know, I didn't know most I don't think I knew anyone else other than you. And so like, you know, I guess it's jumping ahead of it. But it was just great to find a group of people that are super intelligent, like to drink and also very humble. And so it's like the perfect combination. So it was
  
  great. It was
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  I don't know if I agree with all those acronyms for all the panels.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  Well, you're just you're definitely accepting some of those. Brian.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  You hired me at LinkedIn. This is your problem.
  
  Ryan Anklam  
  I'm trying to think I don't honestly remember exactly when it was we we talked about it, I think very vaguely. It was on an off site. We had talked about it. And I think it was at a period where I was doing a lot of speaking. Yeah, it just sounded like a lot of fun. But I don't remember the details very well. Yeah, I'm trying to remember
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  it could have been like
  
  Ryan Anklam  
  one of the winery off sites where we were already drinking a lot beforehand. Wow. They all
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  blend together that Yeah. And I feel like I love how it's always like over drinks. We decided this is good idea.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  over drinks. We decided to drink more
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  Theme here. Yeah.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  See, I joined because, alright, he talked me into it. And like Why not? Like, worst case is it's a bunch of friends having drinks together. We're having a conversation. Oh, that's terrible. Like best case, and then nobody listens. Like, who cares? This is like it takes off and maybe we can help some people out, give advice and give back to the community a little bit with some of the things we've learned and just some funny stories, but a bit of levity. Occasionally, remember, you remember we started off and I don't think anybody's really called us on this on this yet, but we don't do that many deep technical episodes. anymore. Remember why we don't do?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Well I remember specifically and remember
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Episode Two. Yeah.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  You remember why we don't do it? I mean, which one there there are several to pull from.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  You say Episode Two gems. I'm curious why on episode two specifically you thought we were talking about that was with Ben, right? Yeah, we're talking about RX JS with Ben lash guy, specifically that one.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  I think that was the episode when we're like, oh, yeah. All right. So we got a good recording. Down. We got, you know, we got audio. We got that fixed. We've got a good guest. super smart guy. Ben Lesh works at Google. Now. I think
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  now he's moved on to Citadel securities
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Citadel, there's a few people it's a little now. Anyways, that's an aside. So we're like, Alright, he's gonna explain RFC RX JS to us, because this is this is the man who would know. And then he started explaining trampoline scheduling. And I'm like, Oh, man. This is like super interesting, but I don't think it's gonna translate well into a podcast because it's just it's so in depth, and it's really hard to pick up deep technical concepts just from audio alone. And like
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  to be totally fair to Ben, he was a lovely guest. This is like our problem because we drew that information out of him.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't super interesting conversation. But it's hard for people listening to a podcast, there's no visual cues, which he was actually showing us visual cues. And then you're also a lot of people are listening on a commute. So they're not even able to necessarily be like, Oh, let me like, try and sketch that or Google that on my drive. It can be difficult. So we've gotten technical, but tried to stay fairly high level to just give you an introductory into some of those pieces.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  I think we learned some lessons on that one, which is Yeah, we'll get technical, but it needs to be digestible chunks that like you said, someone's commuting or riding their bike and they're listening to us that they can still pay attention to what we're saying. It's not it's not too complex. It's it's actually really hard for all like explaining technical concepts and just audio alone and no visual for sure.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  And that they jokingly call it mouth blogging on shop, talk show. I laughter they say that
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  some RS and Stacy, when did you all join?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  Oh, I just I was just looking back on it because I couldn't remember exactly what the first episode I was on was and it was women in tech as sort of like a guest panelist. And I think I just had so much fun ranting about being a woman in tech and drinking but I like slowly just weaseled my way into like more and more episodes until I became like a full blown panelist. So that was a that was a fun.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  You're actually still a guest. I don't know if I was told you that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, I do remember that. Because Yeah, you started out as a guest that first episode. And then yeah, it was shortly after you joined us full time. Stacey, same with you. You joined us for a guest episode when you first moved to the Bay Area, right?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, yeah, that's right. It's sort of like the tangled web of everybody knows everybody sort of thing where let's see Ryan, Ryan and I, we used to work together in Wisconsin. And so when I came out before what conference was it? fluid? Oh, fluid. Yeah, yeah. And like, met </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />and met a bunch of the team from Netflix at that time. And then yeah, and then when I moved out here, it's like, Oh, you've been working on Ember for a while, we want to do an episode on Ember. And I was and I thought it was hilarious, cuz I'm like, I am not an aficionado. I'm not like, I don't have anything to say that like, people care about, but, um, but I'm glad I did. It was super fun. And we had a lot of old fashions on that episode. Our Donnie old fashions. Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  that's the drunkest I've gotten any episode. That's that was our
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  that was the picture of old catchers. Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  yeah, I made a pitcher.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  Was that the one where we chose the keyword as JavaScript? Oh, I don't remember.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  I don't remember. Either on that one that was a dumb keyword though.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  no, no. The best keyboard by far was memory on the road. Yeah.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Oh, yeah. So with Joffre, who's seen and he kept saying memory
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  or when he came on that episode, I was like, you know, I really haven't drank a lot recently. I've been trying to cut back and then like, we just end up saying memory and we're just like slamming them back the whole time. Like, poor guy.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, we had some like, I think it was German beer that he wanted. He's like, Oh, I want to try that. And that's like the old sweet summer child. This is not gonna go well. How's it go? Great. Actually,
  
  Ryan Anklam  
  it was a good episode. It was great. It was entertaining for sure.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Yes. We've all been on a fair amount of episodes. What all Do you enjoy about recording the podcast? What makes you continue as well? geolocation. Wait, what? Yeah, I
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  was I was also Oh, cuz I can't be there. That's why I can't be on the episode. I
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  mean, I keep doing it because well, it's a ton of fun hanging out my friends. Honestly, I've seen a lot of you in a few weeks, and some people I've seen in years now, Derek. It's like I forgot, last time we on our last episode, we all got together. I was like, man, I missed everybody. And every time I was like, you know, I don't really have that much to say. And then we get together. And it's like, we just talk for hours on nothing. And we just hang out like this with friends. Do we just just shoot the breeze? And that's why I keep doing it. And the other reason is, well, Ryan does all the work. We literally do nothing. Like we record these weeks and then Ryan does all the work. I didn't manage social media and all that I feel bad every every month. I'm like, I should help a bit more to contribute. Man, I don't. And Ryan so does a little work. So watch out to Ryan into you make it like really easy to be able to say this.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  Plus one. 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  100 Cheers.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  100 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  100 Cheers. Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  yeah, yes. I didn't expect to be asked to be a panelist at all. Like after that episode. I was like, I was super fun. And then I was like, Hey, you should come in, like, do these more and I'm like, Yeah, I will. This sounds like a really good time and definitely have made, you know, a lot of good friends from this and that to me, like, you know, kind of what john was saying. It's just nice to like, catch up with people that you care about. And you have similar interests. And it's that you can easily talk about all these topics and everyone's interested in them and it just feels good to like, know that you have a front end community, just with us and then also with like, the greater community, I don't know it means a lot to me. And then I've had people reach out to me like through like LinkedIn and other places, they're like, Oh, I really like you know, listening and thank you so much. And that means a lot to it's like, Okay, I'm doing whatever this silly thing is that we're doing it's helping somebody and that means a lot.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, I think for me, it's I'm gonna continue doing it and love doing it because I'm having fun. Yes, I do some extra work to get this thing out the door, but also A lot of it is because ultimately I like I have fun doing it with everyone. But then also, yeah, people are seeing value in it. And so that has definitely always been motivating to is, oh, well, people actually listen and care about this. So I guess I should keep pumping this out. For me, outside of this podcast, I don't have a lot of friends that are
  
  Ryan Anklam  
  tech in tech. And developers. Well, I don't have a lot of friends period, but outside of this so I love getting out and just talking JavaScript and technology and life with a bunch of people that you know, do the same thing I do for a living over drinks over drinks, but that's always better. I feel like we should have tried
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  to have 100 drinks this episode. Cheers.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  You just want to kill us off.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  I think to to build off of what Ryan was saying. It's it's nice to
  
  chat with other people that are into the same thing. But also outside of your company I know a lot of you all are right Netflix, but I mean, you know, we all kind of work different places but even talk to people on on Twitter to listeners, like just just just talking to people you know, outside of our day to day is nice. And then you combine that with the fact that we're also like, friends and drinking. Is this the first like one of the few episodes where we don't have more people from Netflix?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, I was actually gonna say there's only three of us. Yeah. Is that
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  a first home if it's a first, but it's pretty close to have this many people? 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  Oh, I guess I forgot about who's not Netflix anymore.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Hashtag team Microsoft who team LinkedIn.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  I think it just goes to show from when we started how many years it was three years ago, four years ago. might have been four.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, I think it's four.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  We've just come so far as individuals. It's like crazy. Like what has changed? Like for me, I'll see I've been I got married had a baby switch teams slightly. Just not that much has changed for me. But some some people here have changed jobs like two three times already. Change roles move from like junior to senior, mid level senior like, yeah, it's only been a few years. It's crazy. Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  definitely i've i've radically changed positions twice. I went from senior UI engineer to staff, engineer at LinkedIn, then cloud advocate at Microsoft. And now I'm a program manager. So I've actually had four very distinct, very different jobs during this time I got demoted. Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  I guess I'll say, for me, like, I want to post one. Actually, I'm surprised No one said I just liked drinking.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  I was gonna say.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, yeah. It's just awesome. Talking with friends about something you're passionate about. I don't know for me, when I started getting into my career, I had I was just so in love with front end. I still remember in college, there's this, I remember, I was doing CS classes. And I was like, I really don't like Java. I just don't know what it was, but I just didn't really like it. And then I did a web development class. I just freaking loved JavaScript, because you could just go into the console and do anything you want. And one of my peers told me, dude, don't do JavaScript, you're not going to find a job. It's not going to work out. Java is the biggest language I'm trying to give you like some really solid advice here. And I don't remember. I think it was seriously considering his advice. But eventually I was like, Nah, I don't care. And I don't know. It's crazy how things worked out. But it's it's really cool to find a group that's super passionate about front end, and I feel we're really fortunate to see JavaScript in front end in general take off the way it has, in the past few years. Did you send him a link to the podcast after that? I don't. I don't You remember his name?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  So thinking back to this is our hundredth episode. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Looking back on previous episodes, we've mentioned a few, but I'm curious to hear some of the previous episodes. What are your favorite episodes?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  Can we mention ones that were like not recorded? I was gonna say that one
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  hidden episode.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, so we're at react rally I think it was probably two or three years ago. And we were recording an episode at not on stage at react rally. But while we were there, so we were doing that and then we decided at 2am after the bar had closed. Let's go back to my room. I have some whiskey there. Let's crack out the whiskey. We've already been drinking a bunch. Let's record the podcast. It was so bad. I didn't even listen to it. I just was like, it was so bad. You know, it's the
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  probably the worst hangover after that episode, and I remember not making any sense at all, but I decided it was a good opportunity to go on some kind of rant anyway. So
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  you knew what you were talking about Mars. That's all that mattered.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  Oh, I remember
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  my favorite episode, or at least one of them. And the one that I probably get talked to the most about is the imposter syndrome app episode. I don't that's one of the earlier ones but apparently like that one was like super helpful to a lot of people to realize that like, we all are also imposters and we're all just putting on like the the mask and going I don't know, I don't know about you. Actually, I do, because you've all told me individually.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  But that one, I think has been the most impactful from what people have told me and I have interviewed one which is also really really really one. I think there were like a couple of iterations of this there was like one recruiting one but but I remember the one We were really happy with way back in the day was Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  I feel like we did quite a few with recruiting or like interviews. And I felt like those were really digestible and like really helpful. You could almost apply them to any job. Not necessarily even an engineer or even in tech, like I feel like there was a lot of good information from some of the recruiters that we would talk with. We've had quite a few, a couple from Netflix a couple from actually various companies that have been joined, joined on the episodes, which have been really good.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, I wanted to plus one that, like two that came to mind was the recruiting episode and also the negotiating salaries episode we had with Matthew span, just just because just because I feel those topics are kind of uncomfortable to talk about, but it's something you definitely want to learn more and know more about. So it's nice to just talk about it. Because let's be real everyone is thinking about it, but I don't know there's this kind of I don't even know how to put it So some kind of barrier that makes it kind of uncomfortable like goes against professionalism of sorts. So it just feels good to be able to talk about it with friends.
  
  Ryan Anklam  
  When I think back I think the most fun I had was the rust episode for sure. That got out of hand quickly, but it was so much fun. It was fun. And I think we peaked early on naming. I was looking back at the one with Ben, I think that was the best name we ever had. What was the name of it? That was a sink and drink.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  That's good. That is solid and get better from there.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Shout out to that that one dude on Reddit who was like, they'll never be able to keep up this naming convention. Or anything drinks. hundred episodes later. We we've got it. We still
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  got puns for days. Cheers.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Cheers. My favorite was the first episode. Because we had no idea we were doing like, let's just sit around Ryan Ryan's apartment and record and we got drunk pretty fast. Yeah, I don't know. We're doing shots on that one. I think
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  so. I think he might be right. Yeah, we started off we started the keyword at that point. And I think we have I think we were drinking beer. But then we also set aside shots to drink while we were saying the keyword and the keyword was sprung. We hadn't planned on that. I think I honestly think Jim, you were just like you don't we should do keep, we should pick a keyword. If it's mentioned on an episode. We would all take a drink. And I love it. I mean, we've kept it up for 100 episodes.
  
  All  
  Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Wait, no, if I'm remembering correctly, the original idea was, every time we hit the key word, we're gonna do a shot. Because we're like, sips of beer.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Sorry, that's what I meant is we had beer and shots we had Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  yes. We didn't do that again. I think we did that one time. danger. Danger, though. still my favorite one.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Yeah. And then even then, for the first like, I feel like first like eight or nine episodes, we had one single mic and we just like set it in the middle and all like drank around it. And I remember people were like, Oh my God, your cheers and over the my can Yeah. Which I mean Yeah, it was annoying. After a while.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  I remember listening to one of the early episodes on a flight and I had to turn it way up because like, you know, planes are loud. And all of a sudden that Clank of the glasses and I almost like had an aneurysm that was like, definitely improved over time.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah. My favorite guest from the early episodes was Chico Chico was
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  on the episodes. You can see him scurrying about, yeah, we'd have to sometimes pause like my dog would start barking, we'd be like, okay, we'll take a second for him to chill out. Then back to going into it. Remember, on the first episode, I think we said we had like some questions that we wanted to go over with that article. I think that's what we talked about. Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  yeah. We the state of the state of like, that's it. Yeah. And I remember, remember, we said, like, we'll ask the question, and we'll talk about it and then we'll pause and then like, we'll do some editing later. And I'm pretty sure we'd like never paused and like the rest is history, I guess. Like, like to Jim's point from earlier like, we just think that's what makes so great is it just never run out of things to talk about.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  I know I edit things, but really the only editing I'm doing we have multiple tracks going everyone has their own mic and their own audio track. Really, it's just making sure that the when someone's speaking the rest of the tracks are turned off, so there's no background noise and cutting things out. Brian says out
  
  Ryan Anklam  
  right, but yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  I don't I don't even think I cut that stuff. I mean, sometimes he has to be censored. We have to go back. We're like, do 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  You go fuck yourself.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  censored
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  is so much easier since Brian's moved to Seattle.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  You can go fuck yourself, New York 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  editing has gotten easier.
  
  To be honest, the first episode, it was our goal to just hit to be explicit. We're like, No, no, we need to get the explicit warning and we'll thoughts we'll set the tone there. Brian probably helped us along on that side. Yeah, you're welcome.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  I really like when we had Harry Harry will fun. Just because he's so silly and like his humor is very silly, and I really appreciate that and like I ripped off of that a lot. And we you know, I just I had a lot of fun I laughed
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  a lot and that episode randomly get his laugh is a laugh track for like every episode.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  We should.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Well that's because wouldn't he laughs You can hear around the country so you don't need to laugh. You can just hear it.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  You know, he's gonna listen to this and he is going to be laughing out loud.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Right? And I'll know
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Harry Harry is also one of my favorite guests. We I think we've had him on twice.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Or is it just once? I think twice that sounds right twice.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  I think twice. Yeah.
  
  Cuz like Harry's silly and he makes a lot of puns and you're like, ah, he doesn't really talk about but like, he's deeply intelligent, and it throws you off with this button because you're like he's not paying attention, but he really is. I always enjoy Harry and restore together like a long time ago. Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  the only thing that matches his intelligence is his silliness.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Yes. And His plenary she could have guessed I would never have met surely. Whoo. Like, what? Like she's been on many, many Yeah, hopefully ever on many, many more times, but she's one of my favorite people in the world. It's just like, I wouldn't have mattered without the podcast. Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  it's funny is I think a lot of the guests that we've had on, didn't necessarily even know us before joining. We just like maybe reached out to them and they're like, okay, I'll just come talk to these weirdos on a podcast, I was kind of looking at a rough estimate of how many people were on. We've had 97 guests, which is pretty crazy. I know not every episode we have guests and that may have included Mars and Stacy for their first episode is likely a guest but that's a lot of people that have joined us almost 100 almost 100
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  years. I remember one of the best things we drink on front of happy hours. We bought Ryan a bottle of whiskey and octomore 7.1 which is actually probably my favorite whiskey of all time. And then
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  yeah, we crushed in an episode I think we did and that is that is probably one of my favorite whiskies to this day. I bought a few bottles since because it is so good. Yeah, it's good but
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  you got me a bottle for I did
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  yeah. You haven't left. We should be drinking it right now. I have lots left. But we can't even share it right now.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  I know you only live that far from me Park cross street and we'll have to throw
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  it over the window six feet apart. Speaking of episodes, we've done live episodes, which have been, I feel like had been a lot of fun where we've actually gone up on stage at conferences, and done live episodes. always find them really fun and we will drink on stage which is awesome, too. We don't we don't not drink. I mean, you have to it's fun and happy hour. That's right. It's also
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  stage stage fright front of tons of people. stressful. It does help.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, we've been to what or five conferences? Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  forward j
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  s. That's when I was on. I think we've done for j s a couple times and G Atlanta react on sac J.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  Sacramento one.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Oh, yeah, SAC JS. That was fun. 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  And then actually Stacey and I just recently did one in Ohio at route insurance. So not a conference but that was that was a lot of fun to weed strong drinks there too, Stacy.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  Yes.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  We've also recorded in a lot of cities too. That's the thing is I think a lot of times people think about us recording in the same location. And that's not ever true. I mean, we have some regular locations, but we've done a lot of boardrooms in all of our various companies we've recorded in like San Francisco, Los Gatos, Sacramento, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Redwood City, Sunnyvale, Columbus, Ohio, like there's a lot probably missing some but those are the ones that came to mind.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Well, we need to add Seattle soon right i think that's the yeah
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  we That is true. I did say we need to we all need to fly up to Seattle to hang out
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  or you're talking about like memorable guests at one thing that I think is has been pretty cool. Really cool about this show for me is that we've had guests on that are people in the industry that I don't know, I never expected to meet like people that have written books that were like seminal in, you know, learning about the web or have changed the industry as a whole Aaron Gustafson. To me, like that kind of person, like his book from 2011, adaptive web design like that. I was like, holy crap, we get to meet him in person. That's amazing. And I think, like being a little bit starstruck sometimes of some of our guests it's really like, quite an honor to like, talk to them in person.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, like Sarah dresner. Right. Like that was Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  totally. 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  Sarah Drasner
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Jafar Hussain, Addy Osmani.
  
   Yeah. Henry Zhu.
  
  A lot of big name. Trey.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, Tracy got it. That was a good episode, too. I think that was my first episode ever missed.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Oh, yeah. Hosted Yeah, yeah. You were like busy with some sort of baby.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, some bullshit.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  So excuse Really? Words like that slacker.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  I think he's still edited the episode that I did.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  I believe you all made fun of me or something, too. And I had to edit that and I left it in. So I was like, Alright, fair enough.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  So Jim, are you the only one that's ever like hosted in absence of Ryan? I think so. I think so. Yeah.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, Stacy was a little worried when we were in Ohio the other day because I like cut my flights like really like, tight. Actually a little close especially It was like, right when COVID-19 was starting, it was like this is a thing where flights were starting to get canceled and people were getting a little nervous. It was right like days around that. And I had my flight where I got in there like maybe a couple hours a couple hours before and Stacy's like what happens if he doesn't make it? Am I happy hosting this
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  definitely had a like a giant little anxiety situation. I was like, wait, what if his flight doesn't arrive? And I have to post this whole thing? Oh my god.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Like another shout out to </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />and the one time I host who said it's actually really difficult because you have to like warm up everybody at the key the questions correct. Intro the person correctly like first name, last name, where they're from and all that stuff, but also like it's an art to drawing out people to have conversations without being the main When talking yourself, well, it's easy to just keep talking, but you want your guests to contribute. And like doing that in a way that like balances out between commentary and just keep the conversation flowing. It's actually really, really difficult. So Ryan do a really good job with it. Thanks. But I'm pretty sure I talk a lot to you. I talk more I think someone should want to make this figure. So
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  the funny thing is, the podcast is also supposed to be a discussion. It's not supposed to be even when we have guests like I think we always say like, Don't expect that you have to be the only one talk even though probably they are the subject matter expert. It's like we're all going to be contributing and having those conversations, which I really enjoy, too. So you all have asked the questions the same way. So it's not just me having to host either, before we go into picks, what do you each of you hope to see for future episodes or the future of the podcast
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  or travel I think could be really interesting to like, open up the kinds of guests that we could get to like, you know, to conferences, but also just sort of different parts of the country where we could get like different guests from just like Opening up the community a bit more than we really invitation that, like if
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  people invite us we will come Sure.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  Why not? 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  Yeah. doesn't come to New York, but I'm not paying for her buddies.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  We're just gonna sleep in your house. We're just gonna sit down.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  That's fine. You can sleep in my house. 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  I'm sure Sarah will love to have us all stay. I mean, Sarah's been on many episodes. 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Yeah, time my favorite guest. She's basically a panelist. 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, I think she's probably bid on the most as a guest. I would think so. Yes, yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  I have one that I'm going to spring on you unannounced, is maybe you could consider doing a few remote episodes from time to time for possibly people that have been on the podcast before that, like being on the podcast, but can't afford that frequent flights to just
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  throwing it out. It's funny. We've had to learn with COVID-19 we've had to learn how to be remote and so we've always been in the same room but now we're learning so it is nice having Brian and Derek back. Like I feel like it works pretty well. She put an iPad on a stick. Oh, I like that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  Remote guests and then we just had to stick around
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  telepresence robot
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  No, nothing fancy the robot just like duct tape
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  or like to Augustus back or something like that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  I'd say more feedback from the community those are always helpful. One of I think one of the most satisfying things is traveling abroad even to a different state or a different country. And so it's like, oh, you're in front of happy hour and love friend and happy hour. I love the pics usually about Stacy's music pics, but they're just like, Oh, I love how casual and approachable you all are. And you work at like the biggest tech companies though. I want to get to Sunday and I just really appreciate your dalbert style and advice and usually the episodes are people are like, Hey, you know, can you do episode on this, they usually turn out to be really good episodes, because that's like we're doing this so we can help the community if they have feedback. Those are good. Recruiting episodes are usually what some of the favorite ones just because they're tangible and they're there to the point that people want to talk about and they want To like kind of demystify all this stuff like recruiting and interviewing things like that, I guess for me plus one to actually Brian a stole mine, because I also would love to see us do a lot more remote.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  This whole COVID-19 thing has been a very adjusting kind of thing that we've all had to go through. And I don't know, it's really cool to see us. We're still trying to make an effort to make this all work. Yeah, I also want to post on the feedback because I've always been concerned we'd run out of ideas. There's like, always like, crap, what are we going to do next time? We talked about react 20 times out? Nope. But so I think if the community was open about hearing, talking about what they want to hear, you know, there's always new things coming out. And we can always try to like, look into it. Find people that know a lot about it, and we can talk to them about it. Wait, does anyone else worried that we're run out of topics?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Not anymore? 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  I'm the only one right lips.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  I also feel like on similar topics. We could have something new to say and I don't think we haven't really recycled topics much but think that the same topics can come up in like different flavors. And depending on what's going on in the community, we could start over from Episode One, and just start talking about that again. And it would all be different
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  because things have changed for sure. We just go back through the list and nothing's changed. Let's see. We still don't have web components. Really? That's a day. No, wait.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  We had Trey, Trey was on for web components.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  That was like two years ago. Yeah.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  Right. Like they're coming any day hasn't changed at all.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Nothing has changed. frameworks have changed. A little bit view has come along when it wasn't really a thing for years when we first started. I mean, Sarah dresner wasn't on the core team that when we first started talking to her, now she is that's true. It's true. I think what what has changed most is what we we've said on previous episodes where web development isn't just, I do JavaScript, and I do HTML and CSS and all this stuff. It's now like, you do the back end. So you do node for the front end or you support you you accessibility or you do the style salad components and things like that, like The front end has changed a lot since we first started. And it's only been four years, which is crazy. But now it's true. It's really rare to find that like all around person who just does like everything on the front end, it's more specialized at this point. So I mean, we, we do an episode on that, which I feel like we might have No, we haven't yet.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, I think the reason that show centering around front end, will probably let could last forever is that this entire layer and stack has changed so much over since the late 90s. Until or even mid 90s, all the way until now. It's massively changed every few years. And all of us have had to like either relearn something or learn it and apply it in a different way, a different framework, a different way of thinking about something and it's like that's, I think that's why maybe a lot of us have stuck with it too is it's interesting, it never gets boring.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  It's always a constant new challenge. You are always learning throughout my entire career, it's just something new that I've had to learn, or even something that I thought I knew I learned something brand new that made it easier or better or more efficient. I mean, as long as as long as there are computers and the world is not full of programmers, there will always be a need for a front end of some sort. It doesn't matter how advanced computer is. You got to build something that people can interact with him. That's what we do. Alright, let's hop into another favorite piece of our episode is pics, which since we've been sharing a few different stats and updates, did you know that we've had 1100 and 23 pics already in from the hundred episodes actually. So from the 99 episodes, but we're going to cheers anyways. Cheers. Cheers.
  
  All  
  Cheers.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, at the end of each episode, we'd like to share pics of things that we've found interesting to share. Let's go around the table and share pics for today's episode. Who wants to start it off? I mean, I'll start since I usually go over time anyways, because usually I'll get on some And then someone will pick pick I'll go for another rant. I should mention that was while I'm on a podcast so I can do rants and so on my wife, my dad had to listen to them now it's
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  very satisfying. One of my picks it's not officially picked but I'm going to give a shout out to drew town on Twitter. He went through all of our friend happy hour pics, and he parse them out. Then he listed out who did the most pics who did second most pics and all that. And he's building an app right now. So like sort out all the pics That's awesome. I love that kind of community involvement. But it's cool, nice job to see what happens out of that because I don't even know Pixar. But my first pick is I'm gonna start my Valley silicon fit because people do
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  love the valley silicon pics tastes my favorite. 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  It's just ludicrous. But my first pick is my Valley silicon. It's a TV show that I've been bingeing hard. It's on Netflix. It's called rhythm and flow. And essentially, it's a reality competition for hip hop. And it's just so he's really into hip hop and just the various styles and work that goes into making like one good song. I'd love this job in Beijing. It's so hard the talent is incredible. I'm on the fence about cardi b i she's one of the judges so the judges are Chance the Rapper who've heard of ti and cardi B and cardi B like plays kind of like she's like I don't really know what's going on haha funny but I'm like she's acting she's really really smart because you don't become that successful by accident. I anyways, that's again a tangent. The show was worth watching watch one episode see if you get into it. If you like hip hop here I guarantee you're gonna love the show because it's just a really fascinating look at the industry.
  
  Ryan Anklam  
  Have you looked up all the artists on Spotify yet? I haven't finished the season yet. So I don't know what happens. Everyone's on Spotify. The I guess most of the finalists I've looked up maybe the top six or seven they all have albums on Spotify right now.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  I like to the when you I met like that five left or so. I assume at that level. They're all pretty talented and they could all make a pretty good album. I know they're looking for like the next superstar but the level of talent is just impressive, especially in different styles from Chicago and Atlanta and the East Coast. Just they all sound different I think a lot of people don't realize like hip hop is sounds different depending on where you are and West Coast style sounds a different from down south though. Anyways going I'm rambling. I've been watching a lot of rhythm flow staying up late feeding my son. My second pick is my Valley silicon pick and what's the problem you all have right now especially with the Coronavirus
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  toilet paper anxiety?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Yes, yes, these are real problems I totally pay for so I'll extend it to groceries. That's a real problem. You know, how do I get my groceries into my house though, right? So I go out I can get them but how do I get them into my house so I can get Whole Foods or, you know, Walmart or whoever to deliver groceries to my house, but there's no one there to put them in my fridge. For me. This is a real problem. Fortunately, Silicon Valley, and there's a startup that just started that. They if you order groceries, not only would they bring them to your house, they will stock up your kitchen for you. So they'll put your groceries away nice and organized like a picture to show you that they're in where they're supposed to be. And they're solving this really real this very real problem you know, like, Who's gonna put away my gross? Don't worry, there's plenty of venture capital money starved. Yes, this is a real thing. I'm not making this up. There's a startup that will deliver groceries into your kitchen for you. They said with a Corona virus outbreak they're no longer doing that which is kind of the main appeal they start up I don't really get how they're different instacart at that point, but hey, who am I to judge Valley silicon to crazy world we live Do
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  you have to give them your key? Or like If
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  yes, it makes no sense why like the level of trust you have for some startup with no no accountability, no liability to you give some stranger key. Okay. Don't Don't steal anything. Don't foot my house. Tell us my bathroom.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br /> 
  Alright, I've got two picks both music related as usual. The first one is united Restream. It's a, I guess a group of musicians in Berlin that all got together to try and save club culture and DJ culture and In Berlin just because they're in the same sort of lockdown scenario and people aren't allowed to go out and they're just worried about kind of a lot of people losing their jobs and losing that culture and bullet Berlin's got such a great club culture for tech, non electronic music. So they are streaming. So they'll have some of these musicians like spinning live in one of the clubs, and they tell you when it's going to happen, and then you can just watch and enjoy from the comfort of your Safe at Home orders in your apartment. So that that was really cool. You can donate money, you don't have to pay money, but you can donate money. That's kind of the whole point of it is to help, raise raise money to for that. And then the second pick is a song called pious and tacit by Ponta de Prince. It's a new album, it's off of the new album conference of trees, is a German producer and composer. I thought the description was pretty cool. It's like the album works to answer a long asked question. What does it sound like when trees communicate? The natural instruments are layered on top of each other and electronic beat creeps in as this as if to symbolize a human attempting inter forest communication.
  
  Oh man, it's deep, but it's a really cool song. I like it. Check it out. It's good to good good to listen to like Oh, all right, Derek, what do you have?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Derek Showers</strong><br />
  Um, so I guess since I've been on the podcast, I've had some of the things happen in my life on being having a baby. And so what so I most of actually, most of the things that I've purchased is come from recommendations from Ryan. But one thing that hasn't I don't think come from you that we really have enjoyed is this subscription delivery service called luxury love every I think it's pronounced but they basically send you like a quarterly shipment and it's all tailored after the age that your kid is like developmentally. And they said, it's like Everything's like really nice, like they send you like a book that like, tells you what you're supposed to do with your kid. And like at that developmental age and things to look for. But also, I really like that everything is like made from recycled materials. And it's not like plastic shit. It's like, it looks nice. And it's also suffered has been recycled. So I really like that. And the other thing that I've really been into, I had like, a couple of months off to spend time with the baby. And during nap times, I really had gotten into cooking a lot. And so I think most of this was based on kind of like, on the whim decision to buy a year spiritual master class. And so the one master class that I watched that I really, really liked, actually, there's three of them is Thomas Keller's master class. He's one of my favorite chefs, American chefs and he does he has three of them. And it's more about like refined cooking But it's really interesting learns, I just learned a lot of techniques from it. It was just what I wanted to get out of it versus just recipes. So if you're looking for that type of thing, I highly recommend it. I guess this what
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  do you have? Oh, sure. So I have two picks. My first pick is this comic called Wu Han. I know by Laura gal. Yeah, this was just a, this kind of started getting a little viral on Twitter. But for people who haven't seen it, it's just like this little short comics short story about Wu Han. For those of you that don't know, COVID kind of originated from there. And it's unfortunate that a lot of people associate this province or this area in China for this virus and they're just a disclaimer, don't be addict Asian people. I mean, we don't like it as much as you and it's just unfortunate that came from us. And I think like a time like this, it's really important that we're united and we're working together. For this so
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  yeah, let's not try to shout out to China for getting it under control, though to have better than America.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, better than everybody.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, yeah. There's a lot of cooperation that's happening. Because, you know, because China is so much farther in this, including Italy. You know, they're sharing us all their data of what's happening. And it's really important that we kind of keep that connection rather than, you know, distance ourselves from that. So, just want to remind her of that. And I thought the comic was very cute. And, yeah. And then then my second pick is a sub app from Spotify called stations. I don't know how many people know about this. I just discovered it. And it's just a simple music app that they have that you can just choose music by topics and very catered towards your life, your liking. Very, I think it's kind of similar to Pandora. And I thought it was really well designed. So
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  check it out. Nice.
  
  Ryan Anklam  
  Ryan, what do you have? Alright, so my first pick, I wanted to say stay on topic with the episode and it is Santa Cruz mountain Brewing Company, Brewing Company. Every beer I've ever had from them has been really, really good. So highly recommend them might have a little bit of trouble finding it outside of the Bay Area. But if you do, definitely pick that up, shoot me some. All right next time I'm there. I'll ship you some.
  
  The second pick is a game called my brother rabbit.
  
  I got this for my, my daughter who's eight years old on the switch. It's a puzzle adventure game and a great way to eat up a bunch of time, especially when you're stuck at home right now and you have nothing better to do. So. Check that out. All right,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
  I got three picks. today. I'm going to pick a music one first. This one's called a little rhythm and a wicked feeling. It's an EP from a band called Magdalena Bay. It's a kind of upbeat pop Be kind of dream pop kind of band. I find myself listen to a lot of like much more positive music these days like I really like the new Childish Gambino but it makes me sad so I can't listen to it very long right so like I have Magdalena Bay and oh wonder and a bunch of these bands kind of like playing constantly so I can like not sinking to the pits of depression so definitely check that one out it's really good one second pick here the the other panels can see behind me I have a peloton bike right behind me. I'm not necessarily picking peloton in the sense of like get a bike but I'm picking it in the sense that they have a 90 day free trial right now. So that you can anyone can try it out for 90 days and like do workouts inside of their house. I pick that I'm really picking it because I gave it to my sister and she started doing it and she's loving it. So they'd like the yoga and the cardio and all that kind of stuff. And I like that stuff I do every day. And then my last one is there is a fund We'll put a link to in the notes here to donate directly to the University of Washington's COVID-19 response fund. So if you donate to it, it's directly going to like masks for professionals and like all, like taking care of the staff and like all this stuff directly for helping out with the outbreak directly in Washington. Like, I'll be donating to that, until the crisis is over. I would encourage all of you to donate either directly to that one or to some sort of response fund until it's over Mars. What do you have
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br /> 
  to fix today? The first one is an app that a coworker of mine told me about. There's been a lot of anxiety around this whole situation for me, and it's called a simple habit. And it's just a meditation app. And I haven't really been very good at meditating before but they had like a good starter kit and they have this interesting on the go feature where you can sort of just put in like, if you're having like a rough day at work, do you need five minutes and Just sort of like gives you something so I thought that was really interesting for previous times and for now. And my second pick is a website called backgrounds dot win. And it is the zoom backgrounds award. The So basically, if you have an interesting zoom background, they're taking submissions for the next few days and then they're gonna sort of like pick the most interesting ones in background that they see. So just a little bit of humor that that people have been coming up with during these during these times.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Awesome. All right, and I have two picks both hopefully to keep you from not being bored. I have two Netflix originals, which I feel like that's probably someone needs to calculate how many Netflix originals we've chosen in picks. There's probably been quite a few. Ozark season three is amazing. It's such a good season. I feel like that whole series has been good but I was really impressed with season three, so I highly recommend checking that out. And then another great show that I've been a really big fan of is lacasa de propel season four has just come out as well. And it's I've not done it yet, but it's really really good so far. I was surprised like the first season was so good. But then I was like, yeah, how are you going to kind of build off of that, but there's now we're on season four. And it's still really, really interesting.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  You know, I I tried. I love heist movies. As you know, I love a good heist. And like, I watched the entire first season and I just robbed the move on, it's so long. I guess I'm just I'm probably not that long of attention span. To hear that, like really complex stories. I think it's a really good show. It just didn't strike my fancy. There's a lot of drama that goes along with it. It's not just the highest and maybe that's mostly drama. Like Yeah, ISIS like a background to the drama, but
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  they're like five minutes of heist and drama.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br /> 
  Exactly, right. Yeah. And I did start listening to the highspot test because I do like hice and Brian, you're right. That's a good podcast.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br /> 
  Yeah, it's I think that was I chose that on the last episode. I think so. All right.
