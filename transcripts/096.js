  Welcome to a brand new episode of the front end happier podcast. In today's episode, this was inspired by a tweet on one of our listeners saying that we should talk about how we all like to work kind of like our preferences, what makes us productive? Is it better to work from home work in the office, kind of the pros and cons? So I think it's an interesting question that we can all discuss today. Before we jump in, let's give introduction of today's panelists. I guess you want to start it off?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Sure. My name is Augustus Yuan. I'm a software engineer at Twitch.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Hi, I'm Mars Jullian. I'm a software engineer in the Bay Area and all my thoughts are my own and today they are going to be capitalized
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I'm Stacy London. I'm a senior front end engineer at Atlassian. And all my thoughts are Mars's
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  non capitalist, non capitalist, right? 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  That's like a trademark 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  No. 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  And I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix. In each episode, the front end happier podcasts. We like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all, in the episode, we will all take a drink. What did we decide today's keyword is preference preference. So if we say the word preference preferences, anything along those lines, we will all take a drink. All right, well, let's jump in. I think a great way to start is even from the question that was tweeted at US was really like work from home or work from the office pros and cons. What do each of you prefer? Maybe it maybe it varies, too. I'm interested to hear your thoughts. capital T. 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Exclamation point.
  
  That's really tough. Yeah, I think that really depends on the type of work that I would be doing. And also depending on how far away your office might be, it really plays into your preferences. I don't know sometimes if I'm doing work where involves like a lot of coordinating and it sort of, we're still trying to figure out a way forward. Being in the office is really nice and really easy because I find that working over slack can be very difficult. For Ted's downward like I know what I'm doing I just need to code no one bothered me then working from home is sort of kind of kind of the preferred way to do it. I don't know but it'd be good isolating. I find sometimes if you're working from home it can be really isolating.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  That's definitely been my feeling on the work from home aspect is I show some probably a very similar as perhaps something I need to be heads down. It's a great thing, no interruptions. I know some people even get distracted at home, I'm fine. I'm like, I'll just like end up working more because I'm just like, I don't need to move. I'm no one's interrupting me and I keep going. But I do find it isolating. I worked remote for a year. year and a half for one company. I worked there for years and then had moved and they're like, yeah, we'll keep you on remote. And now I was I was like, This is great. But in the long run, it just became super isolating, like to the point where my wife would come home and be like, oh, let's talk. And she's like, I've been talking all day. And it's like, but I hadn't really talked to anyone. I just been coding all day. So I didn't really enjoy that. So I actually prefer to be in the office. And then as being a manager, it's very difficult to be working from home, I find that as actually you can do it, but I don't like to do it. They if I can avoid it. If I'm trying to run a meeting or even calling into meetings, it's just not that great. hangouts have a need to be better. Like there's there's always some technical issue. So I don't really like dealing with I'd prefer to be in the office.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I'm definitely one of those people who cannot focus because I'm the type person who like associates in areas. This is my fun area. This is my area where I Sleep or something like that. So I was really one of those kids who, who never worked in their dorms. I always went to the library. I feel pretty similar. I felt interesting, far more at work, but I totally respect people who can focus at home and prefer to work from home.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  What if you had like a dedicated like desk area or space? Or would it still feel?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Yes, I think that is probably the if I had a better work, dedicated area in my place, then I probably could work from home. Totally. I also sometimes when I want to work from home, I just work from a coffee shop or something is cool. Yeah. Do you like is it maybe something with the noise and stuff around to like, because being in a coffee shop kind of feels like an open space? Yeah. For me, it's like watching other people working helps me. Like, I don't know. It's just like kind of, you know, everyone's working so hard. You know, I'm gonna work hard kind of thing. Whereas if I'm at home, you know, like teddy bears chillin. I want to chill
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  That's awesome. You're like, that looks comfy. I don't want to be work ready?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, I, I've never worked at a job where I'm remote full time. Like I've never been a remote only employee I've had some jobs were the team that I was on was distributed across the globe. So one team I was on once had like, a person in England, a person in Canada, a person me in the US, and some people in India. And so that was really distributed. And I did end up working from home. like three days, two days a week, it was like and then in the office a couple, my manager was in the office in the US so that was nice to like, kind of catch up with him. I thought that was actually a good balance. Like I got some people interaction in the office and then days to concentrate. Remote. I like I like that balance. I was nice. I am opposite I think probably if it guesses I, I feel like I'm a dog where like you see a squirrel and you're like squirrel. Like Open Office plans are so distracting for me because I'll be like, someone just walk by and be like, Oh, what? Oh, and then you're like, no, why are you even caring that someone just walked by but like, it's in my peripheral vision? Like it's some sort of weird distraction. So it's visual noise. Yeah,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  absolutely. Like it's not even that they're talking to you like it's could just catch your eye. Yeah. And that can be very distraction. So
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  that alone I was like, I think I was joking with someone once about making horse blinders for open. for humans to see just wear this thing.
  
  Like, I can't I hate it. And then noise, people talking is also a distraction for me that I have a hard time, not paying attention to. It has nothing to do with me. But like it's in the area, so you're like, oh, what's what are they talking about? And I'm just like, Oh my gosh, focus but write some code Put your head you know, so then I put headphones on to try and block the audio.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  You need these blinders though. Yes. Audio is covered, but you need the visual binders. Alright, I feel like there's an invention out there or something or like a almost like a tent that wraps from your head to the monitor.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Do you mean like maybe a cubicle?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  What's a cubicle?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  cubicle?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  See, I don't like cubicles? I think they're I feel like enclosed. Or maybe it's because it just feels very like corporate II and it's like, yeah, you here's my box and like, I don't know what it is. I would much prefer to be like, all sitting at one desk like I don't. I mean, I like to have my own space. But there's something that I just have never really liked about the tall, high wall cubicles? Yes, you don't get the visual noise but it's, it's I don't like those either as an option, though, I don't know that I'd want to turn around my head.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I have a solution. Just give every employee their own office. I expect that tomorrow. Thank you very much.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I mean, some companies have that. I don't do Fox Creek. I don't know that I bought that. Wasn't that like a thing? Oh, really?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  What's frog Creek?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Stack Overflow, the creators of Stack Overflow. Like, he's written a lot of articles about that kind of stuff, having your own office privacy, the ability to focus.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I'm curious, you don't like offices.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  No, I, I don't know that I would want it. I feel like it feels like a bigger barrier to like Enter. And so you can't just turn to to a colleague and ask them a question and to the point that could be an interruption to them. So I can see the argument against that. But yeah, going into someone's office has now become this like bigger barrier. And especially like, oftentimes it's like a manager or a VP or director, they have the office, but everyone else doesn't. And like I would opt out of that. I wouldn't want it. I feel like it. Yeah, it just makes it feel like a different. It goes to like our previous episode where it makes it maybe like, feel a little hierarchical or, I don't know power dynamic.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I'd like to turn around slowly my leather chair and mahogany desk. Excuse a What would you like
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  to see? I don't know, would you turn around or you would be facing the doorway? You've got all this space? Take a seat. A pipe? bomb.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, mysterious.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Like this this office is getting pretty bad I
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  would also include a secret door through the bookshelf bookcase to where you
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  have a bathroom in this room too because like that's pretty cool. I never want to leave it you could have like the madman style where you've got a coach just take
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  this becomes its own apartment that are you
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  this is true Mars. This is very true.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Department office.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  You can have a bar at it. That's very mad man. Yeah,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  maybe you're convinced. Yeah, maybe you're convincing me that office is a good idea.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  that's big enough. Yeah,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  yeah. But there yet I still the I'm, I see some problems with the Open Office. I definitely do. But I almost prefer I honestly do and I've worked at places where I've had the somewhat cute Google where you've had like maybe like a couple feet wall like it's not very big but it's just kind of wraps your desk a bit which can you know block some of the visual noise to like the very high cubicles definitely didn't like those to even like where it was just sitting on a long desk. I've had that a couple times where you're just like you just have enough room for your monitor and maybe a little extra room on your size. And then next to you is someone else so I find it doesn't bother me too much. I'm all throw headphones on the visual noise doesn't bother me too much either. But one thing I do hate is when you're back faces people, not that I care that they're looking at my monitor, but the like someone approaching you and you got your headphones on.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  That is awkward. This is this is lizard brain stuff, right? This is like I'm in the middle of nowhere. I am vulnerable. This is dangerous. This is like really deep animal stuff in our brains are like I had not safe on you know something about it feels very unreal. comfortable and it's that
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  somewhat related. But if you're open offices skit, like arranging kind of aisles, the people who are always next to the kind of walking area, definitely have it the worst because they're the most prone to having someone say, Hey, how's it going?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Where you make eye contact? that's about to Yes. Yeah. It's like, Oh, I just open invitation there. 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Accidentally. 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yes.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I will say like, at times, because I do sit there. Actually, I've said there that that kind of location many times, I preferred working from home, like because people have honestly always come up to me to say hi, and it can be very disruptive to say like, Hi, You're distracting me.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah. I just, I just moved dust for a new team and the floors kind of filling up and there's not a lot of space and so the the rows We're talking about this kind of open plan offset office, they tacked a desk arm to the end of it, which is in the walkway. So like, the that person in the person has to like be walked around to go there. And they're like, oh, we're with your desk. And I was like, my worst nightmare. So I was like, yeah, we ended up figuring it out. And we found someone who works from home quite a bit, that they're almost never at their desk. So that person got put there, and then I'm in the office more. So I got some rustle like, thankfully, that was that worked out. But I was like, this may be the worst open office desk situation. Location of all time.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, yeah. I think like, to me, those are ways that you can optimize like, I like what you said, it's like, Okay, well, this person isn't even in the office that much. And so you could maybe play some, but I think, you know, even just hearing these conversations, we have our preferences, and I think there's ways to optimize that. What's that preference?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>All</strong><br />
  Oh, cheers. 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Very nice.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  But yeah, there's ways that we can, as a team, like talk about that. It's like, there's definitely people who have very strong opinions, thank you trying to think thoughts, trying to think of a different word of where they sit. And then there's other people, you could throw them in like, the middle of the hallway and they're like, I don't care. And so it's like, I think there are ways that you can try and optimize and be strategic about where people are placed.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, I guess you mentioned like, Oh, I like working from coffee shops. I have i for i don't know what it is. I think just working on the web for so long. I love having like, multiple monitors and having like my browser in one monitor with like the dev tools open and then my ID or like my editor and a different a different monitor and like other things there too. And just being able to like quickly like look and see everything, and I find it more difficult just like on a tiny screen to like feel as pretty Effective. Honestly, I am 100% in agreement, which is why I prefer working at the office. Yeah,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  like, it's like, I don't have that setup at my home either. So which, so for me, it's like coffee shop or home. It's the same screen size so I but there are a lot of coffee shops that are like super distracting, like the music is way too loud. And even my my, my soundless headphones can still hear their music, which is probably a sign you know, it's like why is this learn your music? Why is this a rave or?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Why are you working out of a club?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yes. That's interesting though. Like even bringing up the monitors and like how your setup I'm curious what is ever on setup like what do you prefer? Like what are must haves? I know Stacy love mechanical keyboard, like, you know, like what are some interesting things that you have set up for your best work?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, I guess I started with the dual monitor thing. So yeah, that's been a thing. I've got that setup at home as well just beside that's like the comfortable way that I dove. You had the mechanical keyboard, which also could prove to be super annoying to your co workers
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  in an office. What is it the loudest? Like the blue keys? Right?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Yeah, those are real loud. Yeah. I think I have those. Every time I'm typing an email. My coworkers are like, looked over at me. 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Mm hmm. Yeah. So if you have like, if you're surrounded in an open office with like, coworkers that are also into mechanical keyboards, that's a good thing because then you all kind of cancel each other out. Yeah, like, know that that's a noise thing that's gonna happen. But if you Yeah, if you work next to someone that can't stand that that's hard, right? True, because you might you might prefer that to be your your keyboard. But if your neighbors like, Oh, it's so loud. Like, that sucks. Thankfully, I haven't had that yet. But I suppose I should probably ask like, be more. Be more considered. One time a co worker. I think she cleverly You know, was trying to bring it up, but she said it in a very nice way but was very clever. She She came to me said, you know, when I hear your keyboard, it's just like so satisfying, you know, hearing all like the little keys. And I was like, oh wow and she sits really far away.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  And so like but that to me is inviting,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  inviting, I was like, well it's really
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  nice but love it
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  that's subtle. Though,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I wasn't sure but it made me more aware of it.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  So Stacy dual monitors mechanical keyboard.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  The final thing which is actually it came up today. I have there the basically standup desks that everyone has that are electric. That's amazing. I have not always had that and so it's it's really great to be able to lower it to a level because I'm super, super short or at least my legs are short. I don't know I for most of my career have not been able to put my legs on the ground like an adult at my desk. To be ergonomical, and it's very frustrating. And so when I got like a desk that could be adjustable. I was like, Oh my gosh, I could put my feet flat on the ground like a grown adult. That's awesome.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I feel your pain. Yeah, completely. 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah. So some people I work with have like stands that they'll put their feet on to
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, in that. Yeah, like the boxes and stuff that I was like, Oh, I don't like that. So having that desk was great. And the there's two, this is very particular. But there's like two models of desks at work. One of them was like a newer one that has like a pho woodgrain on it. And then the one I had was like, This white sort of went from like a thing that would actually goes down further than the other ones. And the other ones I actually made it so that I couldn't touch the ground anymore. And I was like, Can I just keep this white desk? Because it actually works better for me and they're like, yeah, so I rolled it over, but it stands out.
  
  White desk.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  He's just covered in stickers. Yeah. Okay, that's it. Interesting. How about Augustus Mars? What? What are your preferences?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Oh, um, I was dancing on the external monitors I have Well, I used to have to, but where I am now I have one and I keep campaigning for a larger one. So maybe one day,
  how big is it now?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I don't remember. Okay, not big enough.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  That is fair. Yeah. And I
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  have one of those at home to actually like the minute I got an external monitor at home it made working from home a bit more bearable, just because it is hard to develop on such a tiny screen. Um, I also like the adjustable desks, in terms of like being able to switch between standing and sitting. And I also recently got a mechanical keyboard, which I really actually love. But also I'm in a sea of mechanical keyboards, so it's your
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  like, I may as well just like jumping on.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Yeah, I think I have the loudest one though. I was typing very aggressively earlier and my coworkers were looking at me. Yeah, I don't know. It depends on on the context of like waria because at home there's like, you know, there's different comforts and as opposed to Being in an office too. So
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I want to echo a lot of the things. I'll say I guess a few things. One is, I was, I guess there's, there's like those very widescreen monitors. And I purposely chose not to get that because I don't think a lot of people have those. And when I develop for users, I want to like use probably the most normal things. Like I don't think everyone has these gigantic widescreen monitors. So I don't know. I mean, you could just shrink your browser. I don't know. But I like to just do that. So I have two external monitors. I think the sanita is super helpful. You know, we're sitting all the time. It's really nice to have the option to just stand or I'll just walk around a bit. TWITCH gives people gaming keyboards, but I personally like mechanical keyboards. Yeah. And I definitely am conscious of the noise. So I think brown switch. I think brown switches are probably the best. I'm not an expert.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I like those are my favorites. Yeah, turn those around.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Yes.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  If you have advice for keyboards Stacy's
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  an expert but I do it's a rabbit hole. Yeah,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  yeah. So I have some interesting thoughts like definitely standing desks are great. I think like just having the option and the motorized ones are way better than cranks been able to just like set your position and some of them actually Yeah, they lock in position like so you just press a number and it like goes to that spot, which I think is great. Just giving you the auction throughout the day. I don't have a monitor at my desk anymore. But Gus is looking at me. Yeah, but have you all remember like I my job is sending emails and like reading docs and I'm not at my desk that often. I do have an external monitor at home, which if I'm working at home I plug into but I think one of the most important things is a good chair. I think that is like one thing I've learned over the years. Even though they're expensive, invest in a good chair, we will start to be even paying like we're coding for a long time, like long hours. And you're sitting there, it gets sore. And so I think that to me is like I will take anything, don't care about the monitor, which actually having a monitor is good for your posture. Hovering over the laptop is not a good thing. So if you just a monitor can be helpful, but the chairs really important. I actually prefer the 13 inch MacBooks I like the portability. I can code on them. It's not as great as a having a full monitor you're having to like use your you know, command tab a lot, flipping the three between the windows, but I feel like I work a lot on the go. I'm like on a shuttle going to and from work. I'm in meetings I'm throughout the office, it's not typically at the desk, so that's why I don't have a monitor anymore. I sometimes will have a monitor and I find that I never plugged into it. So I just stopped getting one. One thing on the monitors. Have you all tried the curved monitors?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Oh, yeah, I had one at Netflix actually. Oh, you did not. So yeah, I can't remember. I mean, it wasn't that much different. To be honest. It's sort of just you take two monitors and condense it down into one. Exactly. I mean, I was only using three quarters of my screen real estate before anyways, so for me, it made a lot of sense. But I don't remember really noticing any difference in terms of the curvature or anything?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Well, because I think like I've actually had a conversation recently with a couple people who, at Netflix have the curved monitor. I've used it like once or twice, I've never had one, but they like now swear by it because it's it. It almost like feels gimmicky, but once you start using it, it's like you don't have to turn your head as much because that's able to like see the the sides and the dual monitor aspect you now you don't need a dual monitor like this is a big enough monitor and the wrapping really helps. But then you also have that pesky, like, break between two monitors. So there can be value and I've used it and I remember the first time using I was like, not for me, this is too much more like this. And it was also going from not using a monitor too often, that I was just sitting at a desk that had it. So I started plugging in and I was like, Oh my god, this is craziness. Yeah, I
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  wonder if like the like the keyboard shortcuts that so I have like a Windows management like program that I put on top of Mac OS, just to be able to like quickly again, which one you're talking about. I can't remember the name of it. But there's spectacles that have a free one, but there's a ton of them. But yeah, just so I can do like you know, command all left arrow and shove something over to one edge. And so I was wondering about those curved monitors where, like, maybe you just create a lot of like more customized keystrokes because what I'll do is like shove something to the
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  far right or left.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, when I have two monitors. It's like really easy to do that. But then if you have just one giant one, you have to Like, shove it almost all the way to the edge of the monitor but not quite like
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  200 pixels. Yeah. Right. Yeah, I've had a few people, they almost like swear by them now and I see a lot more of them popping up around the office like where people are using them. I, the one guy I work with has like a 38 inch curved monitor. I'm like, I don't think I noticed it until he called it out. And I looked at the other monitors. I'm like, yeah, that's huge. And the resolution on it was like, ridiculous. So some interesting setups as you start to go through these things. Actually, you were all on 13 inch map. No, I guess you're on the 15 inch.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, I have the smaller one. Not because it makes it easier to work on it's literally for weight because I because I I either walk or bicycle to work and for just for commuting. It's so much less weight in the backpack and like digging into your shoulders and you've got other stuff in there.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, it's it To be honest, it's gotten better even If you were like Augustus on the 15 inches huge difference than years ago, I used to go with the 15 inch for It's been a long time since I've had a 15 inch but they were a lot thicker and very heavy and I would use a side bag and I walked 20 minutes to work and 20 minutes home every day. It was a good year so of me doing that going like this is like getting painful. I think I ended up switching to the backpack I don't think I switched Mac books but yeah, the side bag was it was my own stupidity. I was like oh this side bag looks really cool. No, it was terrible because it was like you know, weighing on one side of you and so that was not good either. They've gotten better. Like I feel like the 15 inch MacBook is probably like so much lighter. A quarter of what the MacBook that I had. We kind of mentioned earlier, you can work from home some days you can work in the office, Augustus work at coffee shops. Sounds like each of our companies are fairly flexible. Do a lot of people on the teams take advantage of that. Are there rules at any of your companies where it's like, oh, you can work only two days a week from home or is there it's just kind of very flexible?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  No, I mean, I think it's pretty, it's pretty flexible where I'm at now I think there's like, if you start people start to realize that they're being not as effective the more they work from home but I think it's a really good practice for companies to be flexible just because it promotes like a more inclusive environment in terms of like being remote different lifestyles, like say, you have to have a doctor's appointment, you should be allowed to have a doctor's appointment when when you can make your doctor's appointment because that's just how it works. So I think yeah, I mean, where I work is very flexible. And I I highly recommend it really to anyone just because, you know, people have all sorts of situations that could be keeping them home for one reason or another.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Yeah, my team is pretty flexible. Like if as long as you're getting your stuff done, I don't think anyone really has like issues if there was like a time when I think my team was not in for the entire week because they all want to know where work from home. I don't know why. But that's just how it is sometimes so
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  yeah pretty Alaskans really flexible for a while when I was on Bitbucket there weren't anybody there wasn't anyone remote full time it was like yeah flexible work from home whenever you want but it wasn't like remote friendly and now there are some people that are full time remote and they're working on figure out how to make things more remote inclusive. So like instead of having a meeting in a conference room, where the like say two remote people are the only ones on the screen, but everyone else's in the room, you end they end up like everyone ends up like talking to each other and it just gets it feels I think exclusionary for the people on on the VC so like there's prac best practices to like, oh, if we ever meet people everyone dials in from like their computer and their screen so loves that way like everybody is hungry. Kind of that same interaction. It's like it gives equal weight to everybody.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  So that was kind of I've heard a few people do that. I think that is good. It's like, yeah, you're all kind of being remote. Mm hmm. Kind
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  of like that. Yeah.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I think that's a really great technique. And then I think there's no like, official rule. It's like if someone just suddenly was like, I'm working from home forever. I don't think that would probably be okay. Like, because people
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  becomes the remote. Like, I think there's a probably a broader conversation of like, hey, I need to be remote or, like, let's talk about how that works. Yeah.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  And then we for a while, did like a no meeting day. So once a week, like no meetings, focus day, like, you can focus. And then the team that I was on was like, let's have that be Wednesday. That seems like a nice way to break up the week. Oh, and like, let's all just if you want to work from home, you can. And so, it turned out that everybody worked from home on Wednesdays and you had no meetings. So it was Your focus focus day, which I thought was I loved it. I thought it was great.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  We we have that too. Actually, I love the focus time. But there have been a couple of days working from home on a new meeting Wednesday when I found it more disruptive to be home than to be in the office, just conducting work over slack all day can be really frustrating and actually more disruptive than if you were to be in the office. But I think those were special circumstances.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, I tried to plant like it was nice on those days where like, you figured out kind of what you needed to do on Tuesday, or like if you needed to talk to people and then Wednesday was like, I'm clear on what I need to do. It's like code day, like put the headphones on and like focus on a deep focus deeply on some problem.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  No, I I totally 100% agree.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, it's just really nice to have a day where you have zero interruptions, because it's, it's really tough to context switch. When you're like in the middle of coding, you're solving a problem. And all of a sudden you get pulled into a meeting to talk about x y thing is like content Text switching is like super harmful. So I heavily encourage companies to consider having a no meeting wins, and no meeting. I'm a big believer on the flexibility. I think Netflix has always been really good about flexibility and just having those options but like not not having the nine to five, I think that's one where I'm like, I'm sure we could like Google this where that actually came from. But it's so old, ingrained in like the workforce and it's like, to me, it's like, it's more to what Gus said, as long as you're getting your work done. It shouldn't matter where or when you're doing it. Yes, there's times you might have a meeting that you you know, between that like, maybe it's not even nine to five, it's like the like 10 to four aspect is like there might be some meetings you may need to attend. But like if you're productive in the evening or in the morning, or who cares. It's like the work gets done and if you have doctor's appointments or whatever it is like which can only happen nine to five, which super annoying. It's like you can have that ability to do that. I think like having that flexibility is super important. It's not about being at work from nine to five. I think even more so. I feel like I felt like that. I've always felt like that, but I felt like that more. So even having a kid is like, there's times when you're like, I have to work from home or I have to leave at three o'clock because I need to go do something at school or whatever it is. And I think everyone should have that flexibility. Why is it a trade off? Like why do I have to work can't be around my kid, you know that that's an that's kind of obnoxious.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah. That was, I think a really healthy switch for me when I moved out here from the Midwest because like, there was some flex, definitely some flexibility and jobs there. But it wasn't like, as flexible. And when I remember when I first moved here, one of my co workers was like, I was like two in the afternoon like I'm gonna go get my haircut. I'll be right back. I'll be back in a bit. And I was like, What?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  You can't do that. That,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  but it was fine. Like you're getting your work done that that's fine, that's fine.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  What it's also like, there's times when, like sitting there, you're not productive. Yeah, go get something else done which getting your head cut could be very productive or, you know, that's something you're gonna have to deal with later. And so maybe you're on like the Saturday you're like, I actually feel like doing some work because I feel like being productive. And so I think it is more like manage your own time you're an adult, like, as long as you get your work done. I think that's the important aspect.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  And I think as long as you make sure you set a good culture on your team, that you you know, you say like whenever you feel like working as long as you get your work done, it's fine. If someone's sending out pull requests at 2am and are like emailing people or slacking people at weird times, like, try and be careful of that so people don't ever feel like I don't know so and so's more productive on the weekend. But don't make sure your other the other teammates don't feel like they also have to be
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, that's
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  to be really careful about Yeah, good point.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah. We're working on vacation. Yeah,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  yeah. I think there's a balance there between like allowing people to work when it works best for them, for example, like shifting your schedule, like maybe some people work really well, seven in the morning to 4pm. And some people work really well from like 11 to eight. But yeah, I think that's a really good point to bring up the you can, the optics Can, can go too far. Also,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I also kind of to build on that. And also a slight shout out to slack and Google for the calendar, being conscious of like, remote workers and their time zones. Yeah, I was totally oblivious to that. But, you know, if you're East Coast, you're like, three hours ahead. And but I've seen slack and Google Calendar, they've rolled out updates where you can set working hours and you're very aware of, you know, this person is in a different time zone. This is their working hours, you might be sending something that is not, you're probably not gonna even get an answer, quite honestly. Yeah. It's gonna just be be disruptive. So
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  yeah, like I feel stressed out extending. We have people. We work with people in Sydney and in Australia. And some people in their slacks like you can see people actually will say, set the Do Not Disturb. So you know that like, you can send them something and it's not gonna alert on their phone. But some people don't. And you're just like, I'm not sure. I want I need to get this out of my brain and send it to you. But like, you don't have that set. I don't like are you literally going to wake up right now when I send this to you? Like that's, that's weird. So just stuff like that. Yeah. You have to figure it out. I don't think I have mine set.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I don't Yeah, I don't think I do. But I also don't, that doesn't really faze me. I'm like, if it sits on read, I mean, I'll deal with it probably within a 24 hour period. So I'm like, whatever, but that's a good point. Maybe I should because if it's giving someone else anxiety, like that's not good either. Yeah,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I was like, oh, sir.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  can be like right beside me. I'm not waking up. That's actually good. I like that. It's good. Good advice.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I think that's interesting too. Like this isn't quite related to the timezone thing or the work from home thing but like, preferences, 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>All</strong><br />
  cheers
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  around how you work and communicating them can actually be really effective like one of my biggest pet peeves used to be when people would slack you Hey
  
  Yes, like can it help you and recently there's like a doc at work that's been circulated that's like called no Hello basically, which is sort of just like outlines like, why you should not just say hey, and then nothing else, which articulates everything all of my thoughts and capital letters that I have been feeling for a long time. So well, and sort of I put in my slack status. So now when people slack They can they have context around how I like to work and why. And I've noticed Actually, it's been really good to like communicate those preferences, like kind of what you're saying people in Australia, you're not entirely sure that they have to not disturb where they don't. But just sort of people kind of know the way you like to work. And I've had colleagues to be like, Hey, what's the best way to get in touch with you? Do you want me to come over in person? Do you want me to slack and they've just been really empathetic and cognizant of that kind of thing, just to find the most effective way to work together. And
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  you have that in your status on slack.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Yeah. So whenever someone start to message me, it'll say, you know, no, hello. It's like a link to the dock, for example. And I've noticed that people have not been just going, Hey,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I love it. Yeah, I mean, it's like even like, I've felt like we're getting better with like, having people's pronouns and like, that's great. I like that Mars is that even just like, sharing that context where like, maybe you are bothered by it, so I'm going to avoid that. From now on, yes, I know that
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  we have the opposite at work to where if you do like someone who just says hello, you can there's an opposite doc. Oh,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  yeah, yeah, that's great. I just recently, a new person, it was a couple new people were hired onto the team that I'm on. And they create these, like 90 day plans for them. And it was like, also like, introductory to your team, and you kind of do like, what are your hobbies? Like you fill some stuff out? One of them was what are your communication preferences? And I actually was, like, didn't know quite how to answer it. I was like, I don't know, slack email, talk to me. I'm like, Anything's fine. But that, I think helps clarify it a little bit. Like, there are things that I probably don't like that is it would be nice to, you know, express that Yeah. And for people to abide by it.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah. And maybe I was gonna say that maybe you're okay with like, like, I don't care like and that's okay to, like, totally communicate with me in whatever way and that's fine. But if someone does have that preference, like, I want to be inclusive, if Mara says she doesn't like that, I'm gonna To try and respect that, you know, yes, I'm sure people still slip up. But it's clear as day. I've shared that with you.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I should have I can think of one right now if I have my headphones on, and I'm like, deep in some deep thinking sort of focus work. If someone were to come up to me and be like, Hey, did you get that email address? Like that would drive me up the wall? Like, take my headphones off? Did you get that email and be like
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yes, I did. And I didn't read it. Get to it.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Did you have some opinions on
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, like this? Okay, but but there again, it's being transparent and it's like a trust thing. It's like in our previous episode, we talked about a lot about in one on ones building trust. This is another way of building trust with people is just being open and honest about how you like to work. Yeah, I really like that idea of
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Yeah, there's actually there's a there's a sort of condensed version of it at a website called No Hello, calm.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  We talked about ways of communication and like our desk setups and everything. I'm curious, does anyone have any tips, tricks, things that help them be more productive. Like I'm assuming Stacy has some good coding music, the mechanical keyboards, obviously, you're gonna make you more productive, so much more big monitors. What makes you more productive, those tools, anything that that helps.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I'm with Stacy on music. I finally actually it's taken me like five years to figure out what music I like to listen to when I code or do anything really to sort of like get me in the zone of focus. And I'm actually gonna share that later in the pink section. But also, knowing what time of day I am good at doing certain tasks. I personally like to get my email and all my slack out of the way in the morning so that like I have like a clean slate to start off at the end of the day and probably catching up on some contexts that I've missed overnight or just in the morning and then sort of like doing the have like more intensive work in the afternoon with some snacks. So, snacks, snacks or music. snacks. I don't know. I mean, so I mean, they're kind of in there. I really like seaweed snacks. I don't know they're like chips without being chipped. Yeah, I have to keep chocolate out of the house because otherwise I would eat a whole bar and
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  what's wrong with that?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  my waistline. But yeah, I mean, sort of just having like water readily available. And also Yeah, I also personally, I have two cats called the door monster. So I need to have a cat toy near me all the time, sort of be able to distract them away from the keyboard. Which is really, really important.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I also don't want to assume everyone uses slack. But for those who do use Slack, they added a feature where you can message yourself and I use that as a way Yeah, you can look direct message yourself and that's a great way to just kind of have this diary or notes especially for you. So I don't know, for me sometimes like, especially how we talked about the context switching, you know, you go to a meeting 30 minutes, while I'm not getting anything done. And then you have another meeting, I lose context a lot. So I try to leave a note of what I was just thinking and like has really helped me even if it's like something like you were looking at this file, and you just realize that this component talks to this component or something like that, that has like, just helped me a lot because I will sometimes get lost. And then another thing I just do is sometimes I'll just get off away from my desk and walk for a bit. I think sometimes you can get so deep into a problem and deep into the code that you really just need to step back away from the computer and just kind of like mentally see, like, Okay, what is my mental model of the problem right now and then when you come back, maybe you'll have a different perspective on it. Yes,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  yes. Sleeping on problems. Yes, like, toiling away all day. Oh, like I can't figure it out. Then. You sleep on it the next morning, you're like, oh,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  like in a five minute period, you've solved it versus like banging your head on the keyboard for two hours.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  A mechanical keyboard.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, it's really lovely hearing the loud. Yeah,
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  no, it's actually like some of the, I've actually resolved a lot of issues like in the shower like shower thoughts or thoughts, or you're not even thinking about it all of a sudden, like, Oh, my gosh, I know the answer. No, but the brain processes things overnight and in ways that we can't even imagine.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I like your diary sort of concept as well. I keep like a daily, I guess, a log. It's just a text file that has like today's date, and then I just kind of put on there like, real brief, like what I did throughout the day, or like tasks, I want it but I also bought just below it. I have like to do and I say like, oh, today I want to make sure I you know, reply to john about his question. I have a list of those. So it kind of keeps me focused. I like keeper. I like tab to it and and be like, especially if I'm getting like, lost or off in the weeds or feel like I'm like off track, I go back to that and be like, Oh, this is what your plan was for today, like get back to it. So I kind of do that it helps helps me focus. So that's cool that you do that too.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, I do similar things like notes are important. I've gone back and forth where I write notes in the computer. But I've probably the last a while I've spent a lot of time just handwriting notes. It's I find less distracting. So if I'm in a meeting, there's a lot of distractions on the computer, a notification pops up a lot of things like that will will distract me so i've i've been even writing things in a notebook, which has helped. But then I've another thing I've been doing is reflecting is trying to find time to actually reflect on the day is is so beneficial. It's extra time, but it ends up helping my productivity has been like just thinking about the meetings I've had through the throughout the day. What needs to be done. And just like kind of going back and like thinking about the day, and it might be just looking at those notes can be very, very helpful to like plan for what needs to be done. Do I need to send someone an email or whatever it is, or follow up on something. So I've been doing that. And then another forcing factor that I feel like I think I've done this for a few months now is weekly, I send my team an update on like, all the meetings and things like giving bullets on, like, certain context of things that I've had meetings about, it's helpful for them because they're like getting some insights into some things that are upcoming or whatever. But it's actually beneficial to me, because I'm reflecting what happened this week, what are things like, and I'm writing it out. And so it's funny, it's extra time, it truly is, but it's actually been very beneficial. And then another to point to the notifications and things that distract. I've actually been turning off notifications, you know, not checking email, or having those notifications is like it's okay, like you can get to it later. Time to do it. But when you need to be heads down on something, shut off the world. And so like, it's like putting the headphones on shutting off notifications. Yes, someone might be trying to slack you, it's okay. You can get to it at some point, you just need to find the time that's best to go look at it, then maybe it is taking a break for 20 minutes from your code. Totally.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  One more thing that I think is like been a helpful productivity thing for me has been to use Evernote, but you can use whatever tool that you feel like helps your note taking. But I find that like I toss a lot of stuff in there and I jokingly refer to it as my external brain. Is there stuff in there that like I feel like is like important to know, but not enough? Not important enough for me to be like, I better memorize that. And it's stuff like, I don't know, like how to find where files are living in AWS. It's like, you know, 200 clicks and different screens. And so like, I like alright, it down and be like, Oh yeah, you click you know this screen then they go to here and then this and this and this. And this is how you like update that. I don't maybe you don't have to do it, maybe do it like once a year or something, but I have that note. And I've definitely people have been like, hey, how do you do that thing and like, I don't remember. But I go to Evernote and I pick it up, you know, it's there. I know, it's there. Like, I know that I captured it and then I look it up really quick and be like, Oh, it's like that, like, you know everything like No, no. Evernote knows everything like my my external brain has. It's just yeah, it's like, sort of a curation of knowledge.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I think sometimes to the notion of actually sometimes writing it helps me remember things like I still use Evernote as well. And sometimes just writing something there. I've never looked at it again. But it was the notion of writing it is so helpful. And but yet if you do need to search it, it's there. I think that's so powerful. And it really funny enough. I mean, Gus and I both worked at Evernote tagline is remember everything That's the big portion of it is like, basically offload onto this product. And then they'll search your memories and everything.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I think there's really something to be said for like offloading stuff that stuck in your brain. I remember there was this one podcast about memory or whatever. And they studied people's memories tasks when they were given something to remember when they were given something not to remember. So one group was told to remember that they had to buy bread later that day. And then it was given a memory task. And another group was not told that they had to buy bread and did the memory task. And the group that didn't have to remember something did better than the group that was told to remember something even though it was like later in the day that they had to remember to do that. So there's like a thread being taken up in your brain just trying to remember all this stuff that unless you like, you offload it, your brain space can be sort of like freed up for other things and you become more productive in effect.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I remember that article. You shared it with me and I was like, yeah, that's fascinating. It was so good. Yeah. Awesome. Let's jump in. picks each episode we love to share pics of things that we found interesting. And we're like to share with you all. Stacey, what do you have for us?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  All right, as sort of speaking about productivity hacks or offloading things, numero NIMS
  
  Do you have a hard time remembering how to spell accessibility?
  
  You can just shorten that up to 811. Why is it so numerous nim is just the name of like this way of referring to words and shortening them up and taking out the middle middle letters. So accessibility is one that's like a then there's 11 letters and then there's a y i 18. m is another one for like internationalization. There's a whole bunch of these that are kind of used in tech as ways to like, yeah, speak, speak more quickly. I don't know what that like. It's a productivity hack or something. But
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I mean, writing hacks writing, accessibility is a tough word to write. localizations and other one l Tell Elton and like to remember how many letters. But yeah, it's like a quick form to and people understand it and it's cool. Thank you. That's a good one, which I did not know that's what it was called How To name
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  a numeronym. Yeah.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Very cool.
  
  </p>

  That voice you always have a voice. And then a second pick is a music pick. It's a song called gentle practice by heathered pearls. It's a brand new track, kind of ambient ish in the name heathered pearls originated from the combination of seeking out the allure of something special in a song The Pearl and the casting a haze of noise and erosion over it. heathered So I thought that was I actually didn't know the history of the name. I just thought the name was always kind of cool.

  Also description sounds really cool. Mars, what do you have for us?
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Okay, yeah, so the first pick I have today actually, I remember this Freakonomics episode, from a while ago about the OpenOffice, actually so I've like, I put the link here. I don't know, I think I could be making this up because of my quote unquote love for open offices, but I thought I remembered saying that the creator of the OpenOffice is kind of regretted the concept. But I could be making that up or imagining that he did say that because that would make me happy. And then the second one actually is a playlist on Spotify called the no lyric study playlist, which is not super descriptive, I'll be honest, but it's got kind of like lounge like soft house music, which I really like for coding and deep work because there's like, no words and it kind of makes me feel like I'm sitting in a fancy hotel when I'm working at home and I kind of like that feeling. So if you if you want something to kind of relaxing, but with like a little bit of a beat to it, this is a good playlist for you.

  Augustus, what do you have? 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Cool. Yeah, so I have my first pick is this blog post. It's actually pretty old news from 2015. But it's from the GitHub blog of it's called How to undo almost anything with get and you know, I don't think these are the things you necessarily have to memorize or remember but you know get is such a powerful tool and I still run into a lot of people who don't know a lot of fundamentals of get I think honestly if you have time just sit down and like really really learn a lot like go through one of those like deep dive tutorials of get I think it will be super beneficial. But this was a really like, Well, some article from GitHub they probably know a lot about get so I thought it was worth checking out. And my second pick is well, I'm a weeb. And I love anime and there's this anime movie called weathering with you. It's a very it's by a very, very famous director. He directed a famous anime movie called your name and this is one called weathering with you and came out to theaters for a bit I don't know if it's still in theaters, but I've ever get a chance check it out. It's really beautiful like his artwork. For his anime movies is just absolutely gorgeous. So definitely check it out.

  What's a Weeb? 
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  So we have to be what's a Weeb? Great question. I don't know. It's like how you said you were one. I expect you
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  All right.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Well, let me tell you. It's like, they describe Weeb as those people are like, hey, Sam pie, you know, like those people who say that kind of stuff are very, very into the Japanese culture, but they're not maybe Japanese or they're very obsessed with anime. You know, like, they would marry an anime girl if they could or something. I don't know.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Okay. All right. It's like you're a big fan of Japanese culture and animation specifically. Yes. But to in a very extensive. A little a little too much.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  All right. All right. Fair. Got it.
  
  </p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Okay. No, that's helpful. I'd never heard that term. I'm glad you hadn't either, Stacy. All right. I have two picks for this episode. One that's Little on the expensive side for a presentation remote but the Logitech spotlight remote is awesome. If you're giving a lot of presentations, it's like really sleek, it looks really cool and has really long range. So if you want to walk around on stage while you're clicking your presentation, this is a great remote for it. It has bluetooth that has where you can just connect in through your like USB. It's really useful. I'm actually stealing this from Jem because he had been using it and I lost my presentation remote and took his to New York for a conference A while back. And so I needed to buy one so I was like alright, I really enjoyed this remote and went and purchased it. So it is one of the more expensive ones but it it's pretty cool. So I highly recommend checking that one out. And then I saw a really good talk. It was a TED talk video that I watched from Katherine scholtes on being wrong and it's just like covers all these details around like our fear of being wrong and like it's really, really interesting and how it almost like holds us back and it's actually completely okay to be wrong and that we need to be comfortable with it. It's a really good talk very short and there's some really good takeaways, so I highly recommend checking that out. Well, that concludes our episode for today. Thank you all for listening today's episode. You can follow us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/fontendhh">@fontendhh</a>, any last words, thoughts?
