  Welcome to the latest episode of the front end happier podcast. In today's episode, we are talking with our special guest Sarah to talk with us about civic hacking. Sarah, can you give a brief introduction of who you are, what you do and what your favorite happier beverages?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, so I'm Sarah Yu. I'm a UI engineer at LinkedIn. I work on the economic graph team. And I also work for like a civic hacking project, which we will talk about here. And my favorite beverage is gin and tonic because I tend to get flushed when I drink and it's like the safest thing for me to drink. It's the clear booze, yes.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  All right, well, let's also go around the table and give introduction of today's panelists, Mars, you want to start it off? Sure.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I'm Mars Jullian. I'm a front end software engineer and all thoughts are my own
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Stacy London. I'm a senior front end engineer at Atlassian. And all thoughts of mine or Mars is actually
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I'm Augustus Yun. I'm a software engineer at Twitch. Yeah, I just have thoughts, I guess.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  Young senior software engineer at Netflix,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  and I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix. I don't know who owns my thoughts. In each episode of the front end, happier podcasts. We like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all in the podcast, we will all take a drink. What did we decide today's keyword is volunteering, volunteering. So if we say the word volunteer volunteering, we will all take a drink. Let's jump right in. I'm curious, what is the definition of civic hacking?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, so I mean, I think there's a dictionary definition and like the what it means to me, and I think the dictionary definition is just like Applying technology to issues in the civic space, whether or not whether it be government, or nonprofits or other issues. For me personally, it's means like working on a project that you genuinely believe will make things better. And that's like kind of how I view it because it's a little more flexible that way.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  And does it mean you're doing it without pay? Is that kind of typical?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  I mean, that's like, definitely a tricky, it's a line. I know a lot of people who've been able to kind of turn their projects into sort of money in various ways. For me, personally, I like volunteer in my free time, I don't get paid. I get paid perfectly fine in my job. So this is something that I kind of want to do, you know, in my free time, so
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  that makes a lot of sense.
  
  And Cheers. Here
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  well, I didn't realize
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  oh, it goes by. Yeah, yeah. I've always thought it is Being able to kind of give up basically a talent that you have, and being able to apply it to whether making others lives easier or better. But yeah, to me, it comes down to the nice v word. I'm trying to think of a another word for it, but in your time you giving up my time to to help others. And and I think that's what I've always kind of thought of it as, too. I think
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  it's interesting, too, that it's called. Well, I mean, a lot of people think of it as civic hacking, because it seems to me that a lot of the processes that we learn in our jobs are very applicable to this work as well. Like, I don't know if maybe that's just hacking sounds exciting. But it definitely seems the quality of the work is just as high as at some other places, at least from what I've heard.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, I think hacking kind of takes a bit of the pressure off. Maybe, maybe that's why people use that term, because I think the expectation is that like, again, you're volunteering, like your time and your skills. And you can like put in as much effort as you can give like to the Project.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Well, kinda like what you said to Sarah is that you're, you're working your full time job at LinkedIn. But this is even on top of that you have projects that you're working outside of it. And I think that that is is like kind of what Mars is saying is you're taking this skill set and applying it and being able to leverage it.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, does the hacking thing kind of maybe also indicate like, maybe there's an existing thing, and you're just sort of incrementally improving it and doing it kind of quickly. But it doesn't necessarily mean it has, like, all the I don't know, things that you would put in place for, say, like, incredibly strong production ready software, but it's still useful and beneficial, because it helps.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, I've found like working on this project to be really freeing, honestly, because yeah, you have more space to have things ship and not be perfect. And also, you can take more risks with it. And I think that was like an unexpected sort of outlet for me that I didn't anticipate when I started, which is really nice.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  So it sounds like you're on a typical project that you're working On, I'd love to kind of hear about the project, but also like, what kind of projects does that entail? Like, what is Civic Hacking? Like, what are typical projects that kind of fit in the world of civic hacking?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Sure. So like the project that I work on personally, um, it's related. It's called web monitoring. It's part of the environmental data and governance initiative. And basically, what it does is it basically tracks changes made to government websites, we essentially show diffs that analysts actually review to see if any sort of meaningful things are happening in the administration, that they're not necessarily, you know, surfacing to the public. So we've like, This project has found a lot of interesting things. One is that the, the term climate change and other related terms are sort of systematically being removed from EPA and other websites. They're sort of isolating pages. They're not necessarily deleting them, but they're removing references To these pages, so essentially, they're dead. But when you delete something, I assume there's like more of a connotation. So this is like kind of a more subtle way to make sure that people don't necessarily find this information.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  It's not in the primary navigation anymore. It's just like an orphan page. Exactly. I guess the only way you're finding is probably SEO or like a site crawler, which sumen that's kind of what you're probably using for the project, too.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah. So this also partners with like, the internet archives, so yeah, so like, sort of works in tandem. I don't work as much on that side. I work more on building out the UI that analysts actually use to, to find the pages and, and basically, they create a packet of findings that they give to journalists to report on to kind of show let the public know like, what is happening.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  What else kind of fits into a civic hacking project, like is there a Is there a type of project that defines that or, as we mentioned, volunteers, Cheers, cheers. Does that just define
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  I mean, I think again, like that. So there are a lot of different projects on there, there are a lot of projects that partner with local government, there are a lot of projects that partner with nonprofits. But I've even seen people who've just like developed relationships with like, say, local businesses or local like, you know, social, like organizations and like built out technology for them, like on a sort of personal basis. And, and for me that it also includes that kind of work. So the project I'm on like, is through Code for America. And they're like, a set number of projects that are basically like hosted in that space, like on Wednesdays so but there's like a lot of ways to find projects. So I'm curious
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  for the rest of the panelists. Have any of you actually done any outside work, especially outside work? I think that's a good way to look at it too. Is that where you're giving up your time and applying your skills? Have you ever done anything like that?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I don't know if this qualifies as Civic Hacking or not. So I did a hackathon in gem also did this at any cannons, and it was a day to just kind of help kind of push through some of the ideas that they have to help survivors of abuse and kind of come up with either code to solve that problem or, you know, help help get those ideas more defined. And so that was like a day that, you know, just dedicated to that was really cool. And that was Brian Holt as well.
  
  Shout out to Brian.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Yeah, yeah. It's it's cool that you mentioned that because when I also thought as civic tech hacking, I think of all the hackathons that really target like trying to help good like, he go under this premise of hacking for good. Or maybe they'll set a goal that says, hey, you know, this is the theme. We're trying to hack projects that will help the environment or help certain government problems. And so when I think of civic hacking, that's like the first thing that comes to mind. I haven't personally done any of that. I wanted to volunteer. I think anybody who Oh, Oh dangerous, don't
  
  Unknown Speaker  
  worry, that's the word.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Cheers, cheers. Bye I encourage people to spend their free time to go to those but not participate directly but mentor one that comes to mind
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  it was a few years ago, probably more than a few years ago now. But there's one point where I helped just completely overhaul and build the Humane Society site and basically make it more of an a web application so that they could manage their time for employees and and also just the actual site for others to be able to adopt pets and like, that was just something I did in my spare time. Yeah, use my skill sets and build something that you know, I kind of like what Sarah said, too, is there's a lot more freedom to it was just like, they're like, yeah, we just need something better than what we have. What do you want to do and it kind of gave me the freedom to just do that. There was a lot to do but it was cool. I could just do that in my spare time. Obviously outside of work, civic hacking the V word When it comes to costs, it's it's time how much time a commitment do a lot of these projects require.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  I mean, I think again, like, it's really how however much time you want to put in, I think some people are intimidated because they think it's going to be like a huge chunk of their life. And it can be if you want it, but it also can be like a one day hackathon. That's very valuable. It could even be like on like, we're kind of using like, civic hacking isn't its own bucket, but I feel like you can even kind of practice those same principles like at work, right? Like, if you're speaking up for like, an ally feature or something like that, like I still kind of in my mind, that falls into the same bucket, right? Um, it for me personally, I spend maybe like two to three hours a week and I could definitely spend less I could spend more but that's like what I've personally been comfortable with. I think it's more what I've noticed has gained more traction is if you're getting system, not how much time that you spend because it takes time to like ramp up on the codebase. It takes time to like, Get familiar and get acquainted with the maintainers. So even if you only like, you know, show up once a month, if you keep doing that it can make like a big difference. So or Yeah, like really well defined projects, like hackathons and stuff like that are also like super useful. I'm a fan
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  of what you said to have consistency. I think that's, to me, always a big one. Even this podcast, knowing that we release bi weekly, it keeps the cadence and making sure that it's like, oh, well, we've got to do this. Having that cadence or consistency really helps just mentally for me is like I prep for that and make sure that I have that time to do it and sound like two, three hours a week. That's that's actually not too bad to give. I mean, that's just likely going to come out of my binge watching time, which is, you know, like, I could probably apply to something else, which is very cool.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Yeah, how much time you waste everybody like on social media or some silly thing that you could easily replace? On my iOS
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  phone keeps telling me how much I spent. It's kind of depressing. So I could be applying to my skill sets to do something better than that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  I really like also what you said, Sarah about how it can come off as really intimidating. But really it is sort of like what you make it in terms of like, it could be two to three hours or it could be less if that's the only the only time that you had but at least for me personally, and then people I've spoken to just the amount of time seems like the largest barrier to entry, and also not realizing that these projects are they are in flight. So it is incremental, you're not building something from the ground up necessarily. So it's a little bit less scary in those ways. I think which I found kind of eye opening recently.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, I mean, just to like put it in context. I like worked on a feature that wasn't super complicated for like two or three months, which in my if I was working full time like that would be a big deal. But like for for this project, it's totally okay to like take your time and like sometimes you have to drop off for a couple weeks and like that is totally acceptable. You know, again, like, I think people like these projects in general are just like really happy to have like, experienced and engaged like developers and other, like specialized people like work on them. And so they're not going to be like pissed off. If you're gonna if you're you can't spend like 10 hours a week,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  you're giving your time. It's hard for someone to be like, frustrated, mad. They're like, you're not giving up more of your time. It's like, That's tough. Yeah,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  yeah, in general, people are just happy that you show up and that you're interested, right? And then also just like think, like showing that like, what they're doing matters to you as well. So
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  that's interesting that you say like two or three months for a feature? I'd be curious to know like, cuz How do they manage timelines? And then what sort of if you have new different words, people who give their time for projects like that seems totally reasonable from, from your perspective, how, how are the timelines managed for projects going forward?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  I think it really depends on the Project like, for example Code for America, some projects have really active like PMS and like designers and like other projects, again, it also depends on how like where the project is in the phase of development, what the nonprofit like is like the nature. I think part of it is again, like finding a project that you really care about. And also like the the way things are developed, like, feels really comfortable to you, because you can be really selective and just pick like the perfect fit for you. For the one that I'm on. There's, it's it is like pretty freeing, like I have been basically choosing features. there's a there's a general list of like what needs to get done, but I pick what I want to do, and there's no expectation of like a timeline. And that has been really great for me because then I can just commit to like what I'm capable of committing, which really varies.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I like that too. And I think you mentioned some Then there is like almost being passionate about the project that you're working on. I think that's super important too is that, you know, consistency, but also passion for helping to drive towards something you're like, yeah, I truly see the value in this and I'm adding to this and that that can be really helpful. I'm also curious how big it like just even specifically the project you're working on how many other people are also working because you said there's a list of features and things that need to be done. How many other people are working on it?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  So I i've like talked to Mars about this to the team is fairly small. There are probably four developers, there's like one person who's like very dedicated. He's like, super engaged on the project. That was actually one of the reasons why I joined was because I realized I didn't want to be on the hook to be the maintainer, because I knew what I was capable of committing to and I was not a I didn't want to be responsible for whether or not this project like lived or died. Right. And that was really helpful for me to have someone who was already like, sort of built it from the ground up and I was sort of adding on In, but not fully responsible for the success of it. I think total, we probably have maybe three or four people that are really like engaged in development. And then we get a lot of outside people who maybe build out a few features. And that's still really useful again, like, it's what you can commit to, even if you just like build out one feature for one of these projects, that's still like a big deal, right? So yeah, we get a lot of, you know, people who, who like who help out for like, a couple months, and that's like, still really useful.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  I also love how you mentioned, you mentioned there were like PMS and designers also on the team. And I feel there's this connotation with Civic Hacking that you actually have to code, have to build something but even designing, there's a lot of things that are needed. Like, actually, like one of when I thought of civic hacking, I feel like they have the hardest problems like I was reading this hackathon of this designer who participated in trying to solve traffic. Like I was like I need I don't care what it is I want to hear what it is because I hate traffic and Bay Area. And it was crazy. He He created he designed this vehicle that is like it like crawls above traffic, it creates a wheels on the side lanes. And basically it's this thing where bunch of people can like go into it. And they're like lifts of the traffic. And he's thought of all these cases like oh, weapons, if there's a bridge, and there's all these like things, and it's just a design, but at least gets the discussion going, like know, why wouldn't this work and stuff?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, it's not totally out there. It's like, it sounds like it, but it's like, maybe this is pausable or it's just getting people to think about a problem and saying like, Hey, no one's really thinking about this at this moment. Like how do we how do we discuss this and plan around that? I also think it's interesting too, is I guess what you said, What comes to mind too, is like what's the skill set needed? And I think you're right, like it's not hacking To me it Yeah, you're right. always kind of feels like engineering or developers that can even be someone brand new to this. Learning coding could be doing some of these projects is a great way to, you know, I always say like, jump in and create something this is a great way to do that is like, Hey, you want to learn how to code something while this is a good way to actually apply some of the things you've learned and continue to kind of bang something out? and not having the timeline is really, really important to
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, definitely. We've I've like seen a lot of people sort of like ramp up their software engineering chops on these kind of projects. And again, it seems it's kind of like a win win situation, because they learn and they're all they also like, helped make the project better, which I think is like really great, you know, and it's also exciting to like help teach people who are excited to learn
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  so it could be like a good mentoring opportunity to feel like are super, you've been doing it for a long time. It's a great way to like get in touch with people who maybe are just starting out and helping them to how do you find these projects? I think that's a that's always comes to mind. Even for me like when I was doing just like like a humane society site. It was just something That kind of fell into my lap in the sense that like, I knew that skill, I love animals, and it was just kind of like, Hey, we need this. And I'm like, great. I'm happy to help. Let me do it. And I'm curious, is there ways like if I today was like, I have extra spare two hours that I should not be spending on Netflix? What should I be doing? Like? Are there ways that I can just start to like, quickly dive into something?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, I think people I think that's another misconception that is like really hard to find these projects. And it's really hard to like sort of break into it. But honestly, there's like a lot of avenues. I think the easiest one for that was easy for me was going to like the Code for America meetup that's already on meetup calm, you can just like go and show up and they actually have a time where they pitch projects like at the beginning. So there's like a series of projects that people are looking for, you know, people to work on, and you can just go there and like, you know, talk to the different teams and like talk To the different to the different, you know, project managers and stuff like that. There's also a lot that you can even just like find on GitHub. There's also, um, like, to your point, you're saying, like, yeah, there's a lot of hackathons out there that again, you can, you can go there. And you can also meet people who are probably engaged in the community, and they have a lot of suggestions. And if you're not super social, like what I love about it is like, for example, the Code for America, like Meetup group in SF has a Slack channel and you can just go there and kind of just like kind of lurk and people will post projects in the in the main Slack channel, and then you can just reach out to them directly. Like you don't even have to go to the meetup and like, put yourself out there. So I
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  didn't know about that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, that was good for me because I am not always the person to like, just go and be like, Hey, can I work on this? Like, you want me on your team? Like that was very intimidating for me too. So
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  yeah, I think that's the tough thing too, is like we all we always say like Go out meet people go to network and everything like that. One, it's not that easy to just jump in and do, but to it's also that's a time commitment on itself. Whereas, like, if you could just jump in a sock room and you're like, you know, Vol, you could actually search history and just find something and be like, wow, I'm super passionate about that I would love to help like, that makes things a lot easier.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Yeah, the Slack channel sounds great, especially if you know some of these some of these things require like it matching up with your schedule, which sometimes can be the hardest thing. So if you can do it asynchronously in terms of finding the opportunity in the first place, and then the actual work itself, that can solve a lot of like scheduling headaches.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, I love the slack channels. I've from what I know like almost every like Code for America, like Meetup group, like in the US has their own Slack channel, and then there's a general one for the whole nation. So yeah, you can just join those and just see if anything, like speaks to you. And that, you know, requires like one minute of your time to join a Slack channel. I feel like we do that like all the time. I have too many slack.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  But yes, it's a great way to like jump in and be able to like join. I like that
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  there's usually some government agency that pick the agency and they usually have some sort of open source. NASA has a pretty big one, like pretty solid repository. co.gov is pretty solid. usually pick an area of interest and say, like, I want to do open source work in there. And there's usually something going on how well maintained that is depends on kind of that particular agency. But I, I'm with you, I think local governments probably a little bit more applicable because it's your town. And it's like things you could apply to your day to day and your neighbors things like that versus like all of America.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I like that you said Jim to have like even sounds like open sources kind of into this realm is like GitHub and repos that are out there is like, you can absolutely be contributing to that too. Because I think like that's a great way is there's a lot out there already, but
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  it's like you're not familiar with that world. Like you're you want to help it like and you want maybe are just starting off in dev but maybe You're not super familiar with open source or like, get, do organizations like Cofer America kind of help. Those kind of people make a little bit easier for them to join in.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  From my experience, there are a lot of people who are just starting out who like go to them meet up. And yeah, again, they're, they're interested in the project, they are also interested in learning. And I think usually, again, like people are just excited for someone that cares. And that like wants to work on the project. Like it's really not like a sort of ivory tower situation, where you have to, like, prove yourself with like a coding challenge or something to like, work on it. Thank goodness, there's no whiteboarding involved. You just have to say you're interested in like, people are more than happy to like, help you out. And I love that about the community. It's like very, like humble.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Nice. That's awesome.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  day soon, I found a coding challenge.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  I'm not a fan of those.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I do like that. There should be a lot barrier to entry when you're, I mean, you're giving up your time. Like, I think that's really important. And we're all going to come at it from a different skill set. It truly is. And we should encourage it more and more. I think it's a great way to learn. But yeah, if you're all Yeah, you've got to be like very senior engineer to contribute. Well, that's, that's no good. I think that kind of goes against the mentality of actually being able to all contribute to it.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Yeah. And I think it was so kind of eye opening to me when Sarah and I first started talking was that I think the perception is really, that it's so hard to get into, but the reality is that it really it really isn't. And I think it for whatever reason, it took just talking to someone who does this on a regular basis to really understand that. But also, like, Sarah, for your passion to show through in terms of the types of type of work also was really eye opening as well
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  to Mars. It was something you thought about before, like so you and you and Sarah met each other at an event that you were both speaking at, was it something you were thinking about? And you're just kind of like oh well, I would love to do that. But just like it's one more tax to think about,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  yeah, why, like you said, you volunteered for Oh, shoot volunteered. Yeah, it's been a while for the Humane Society at one point. And I had a similar experience with the SFS. PCA, which was to work on sort of like a find your pet kind of application. But that did not go very well, at the time. It sort of like fizzled, and Stacy and I actually went to the Code for America meetup once, but it was like an unusual one for them. So it, it was, I guess, in both of those scenarios, it was hard to find sort of the in sort of like the correct person to give you sort of the information that you personally, me personally needed to hear. And also like the ways of actually connecting with the community, and that sounds circumstantial, more than anything else, but it was sort of, you know, building up that perception in my mind, the one agency I worked for, every year they would try and actually give out billable hours towards some volunteer work.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  trying to think of different words, cheers. Just a cause. We could apply some of our work and build an application for and and there was there was a couple of things over the years that I worked on, which I thought were just amazing. It was really cool. Because there again, you had a lot of freedom and you're working with your colleagues on it too. And just saying, like, let's create this and it was almost like a gave you the ability to just try something different. There was nothing prescriptive of what technology used or how you did it. Everything you created was going to be that much better because nothing existed before and I think that was really, really cool.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, I totally agree. A lot of times the you're building things that do not exist, so even if like what you're building is just like completely unstyled or heaven forbid you use bootstrap or something like that. It is significantly better than like, what, what is out there. I think another thing too that I think is important to know is that like for me, like I decided to do this From also like a mental health perspective, to be honest, like I wanted to direct the sort of energy that I was feeling like, you know, I wanted to I wanted to direct the sort of angsty into a way that I felt was positive. And I like actually, since I've been working on this project, I've noticed that my sort of mental health has like improved, to be honest, to feel like you're working on something that is really like making that impact has really helped me out. So it's like, not completely 100% from like an altruistic perspective. Like you also like, from my experience, I also get like a lot out of it by working on this.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  That's a very, very good point, too. It's not selfish, but it's like, yeah, this is something that you care about and you feel good about too, is can be very good and uplifting as well. I probably also get different creative on something that you're not necessarily doing all the time. at work. You can do something completely different.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, I think the point is that it isn't Just like you're doing something because you feel obligated and it doesn't feel good. Like it should make you feel good to work on it, it should be giving you energy and like not taking away energy. And if it's taking away energy, then yeah, maybe you want to, like look into a different project or look into different ways to like help. Um, so it's like, definitely doesn't have to be like for everyone. But yeah, it's like, definitely helped me out a lot like personally.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  So we talked a lot about like coat America came up quite a few times. And I'm curious, like, that's a great example of civic hacking. Are there other organizations, other things that we should be thinking about that maybe help our listeners to as if they're wanting to spend their free time like what's, what are they passionate about? And how do they get involved in like what organizations exist
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  so foreclosure America specifically, I know a few years back, I looked into it and I had heard of the idea of like fellows and making it something a bit more dramatic than just a few Two hours a week where, you know, you do it full time. It's a commitment for, you know, a period of time. You work for Code for America, but then you get placed in another cities and you kind of run squads or something. I don't know all the details about it. But I think you can get much more deeply involved if you would like,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  yeah, that exists. Yeah, I mean, honestly, sometimes what I've done is I just like, go on Eventbrite, and I look up civic hacking, and then things pop up. Like a lot of it's like, like accessible through Google search. And like, I like, I think, like, another thing that's important is like, I'm not an expert in this space, either. Like, I'm just a regular developer, who found this project that I care about, and I'm just like, working on it in my free time. Like, it's not necessary. It's, it's, again, it's a lot of finding these projects is a lot of Google. It's like a lot of looking on GitHub, looking on meetup.com like finding these spaces because they're already out there. Another one that occurs to me is like the US digital Service, if you want to, again, dive deeper into it, um, like, that's where you can really like try to make the technology better in government services. So, yeah, they're like, all of these things are definitely out there,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  which we already do have the skill as engineers to be googling stuff. Like, I feel like that's what I do on a daily basis.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  So, I mean, this should be pretty easy. I also want to call out that for a lot of students. You should look within your own colleges, organizations, student organizations, because there might be organizations that are targeted for civic hacking. So I know UC Berkeley, one of one of this, these interns, Helen at Evernote, and mentored for she was really, really active in an organization called blueprint for UC Berkeley. And literally, it's just a student organization run by students and every every year they commit to like helping with a nonprofit or some, some project that basically can rally all the students together. And it's a really, really good way to like learn. Like they have all their projects on GitHub so anyone can contribute to. But so it's a really great way to, if you're, especially if you're a student really diving in experiencing what it's like to like, be in a scrum like environment. It really, it's a really, really good opportunity. And if your college doesn't have those in organizations, there's nothing stopping you from starting it yourself. Like I think that's also something to remember that you can just as easily start this year college. It's a really, really good opportunity. And plus on what like I said, there's a ton of people that messaged me on Twitter and like, Hey, can you look at my resume or, you know, I graduated boot camp, stuff like that, but they don't have any real world experience and options. There are well you do some open source project, which is cool, you know, like, yeah, you should do that. But if you work for like a civic happening or nonprofit or something like that, you get real experience for real engineers, which is very different from what you get learning In school, plus you have real experience, you can be like, Oh, actually, we we dealt with that, plus the barriers a little lower because no one's paying you. So you're not as obligated, like, you're still gonna do a good job, obviously. But you don't feel like the pressure of like, well, they're paying me I have no experience. So that way, when you go to apply for a job, you can say like, Yes, I've worked with teams and designers and things like that. It's a really good intro way, that gap between like bootcamp and college in the real world,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  it also sounds like, based on what Sarah said earlier, like a good opportunity, like another avenue into finding a mentor. While you're sort of like in between stuff, in order to like, kind of accelerate some of that real world learning.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, it's creating something for your portfolio, essentially, right? Every time when we say like a new grad, that's the hardest thing is trying to find an actual job. It truly truly is. Once you have the first job, you're like, Yeah, I did this, this, this and this, I can go find the next job. But that first job is really, really hard. And so if you're like, well, I helped create some new city site or you know, my town website, there's things that just needed to be better. I built a Application made things more efficient. Now you can actually point someone to that and you can an interview can actually speak to that. And I think that's really cool, too. It's beneficial to others, but also you hopefully learn something and also can apply that to the next job. I think
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  some government
  
  agencies also make a lot of the data public. And so if you're resourceful and you have the drive to want to maybe figure out some answer to some question that you have, you can, you know, to kind of dig in yourself and, and maybe, like, expose that data and make an app on your own even that, like, answers a question that you have, and maybe no one's answered it before. But you you have, like, all this data at your disposal to do that. So like, self initiated, things can be a part of that, too.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, the government has a list of public API's that you can hook into. And that is, like really exciting and also intimidating.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  It's their treasure trove.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  You can do a lot with data. I mean, Google, even like Augustus mentioned the like traffic problem. I mean, like Google has API is you can dive right into a city or town, and really isolate that and leverage data that's already available. It's open source, and you can do something really cool.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Yeah, if someone will solve the traffic problem, I will be forever in your debt. Are you going to start paying them? I
  
  honestly I would. I would go to your GitHub and you know, right.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, because now we're actually paid somewhere on GitHub. Yeah. Or some
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  something. I'll give you a hug or
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  something. A guest hugs going out. I
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  like it. Not as good as gems hugs, but their heroes are worth a lot more really. Oh, golly. Geez.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Before we get into pics, I would love to hear your thoughts on like, what's one piece of advice that you would kind of say to someone who's maybe wanting to get into Civic Hacking or our beautiful beautiful keyword volunteering Cheers. Yeah, what's one piece of advice,
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  a lot of companies offer that. But if your company offers you the ability to do volunteering, on paid time, do it for civic hacking. Like, that's great. Like, I take that, you know, corporate corporate money and push it out towards something, you know, good. And I think that's a great way to spend it and get involved that way. And then you'd mentioned using slack to like trying to kind of get into some of this. But also ask a friend, it's a great way to like, you know, Mars, and I went to a Code for America meetup feels a little bit less intimidating when you go with someone that you know, like, do something like that. And that's like, an easy way to kind of ease the stress of kind of going into something that's unfamiliar. You said the word so.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>All</strong><br />
  Cheers.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Cheers. Yeah, sorry, I know someone's gonna call it out.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  I guess like for me, like what I've said before is again, like pitch, pick a project that you really believe in. Don't just use it to check a box like actually believe in what you're working on. Because it's really Tough, like when you're really tired, and you really don't feel like working on it to work on something that you don't actually feel invested in.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  That was the one that I was gonna say. But I will, I will reinforce that, you know, I think passion. If you're really passionate about the problem, I think that's really important. And also, I don't know, some people get really intimidated that, let's say there, for example, they're contributing to open source, like, oh, everyone can see my commits doesn't look good and stuff. Don't Don't think about that. Honestly, nobody actually really cares. And nobody really dives in it says, Wow, this guy committed a comma deletion. What a waste of what a waste of a commit, you know, that should have been squashed or something. nobody really cares about that. I feel a lot of people get really intimidated, sensitive about that. And, you know, really just focus on what you're trying to build. And that's really what people care about.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  Sarah, I like what you said about you feel better after doing this. And that's super important. I think increasingly as we mature in tech and as engineers A lot of us do things that are working in areas that are ethically gray, as in like deep user tracking across the internet and selling ads and things like that. I'm not I'm not here to judge today. Maybe Maybe next time, maybe another episode.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Definitely, definitely touch on that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  Yeah. But you know, if you feel if you work in industry, and you're like, well, I gotta get paid and like, I got to feed my family, but I'll naturally feel good about what my company is doing. Like try to offset that a little bit. You know, I'm not here to judge how you make your money. But, you know, you can do a little bit of good in the world and like, volunteer and, you know, try to try to balance out that karma. Cheers. Cheers.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  All right. Before we end the episode, we love to jump into pics of things that we found interesting and would like to share with our listeners. Let's go around the table and shutter today's pics. Mars. What do you have? Oh, don't start with me. Okay. Oh, yeah, no, yeah. Getting Yeah, I'm sorry.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  All right. Um, I have a somewhat valid silicon pic today. I know. Sorry. Sorry, Jim. It's called the theater. Gun, which is for like sports recovery and also like muscle activation. And if you hate foam rolling with a passion like I do, I highly recommend it.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  You get the foam rolling.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  It's just so difficult. You gotta like contort yourself to get to the
  
  rolling, which is difficult. Yeah, so I think that will be my singular pick today, because it's somewhat
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  does it work though? Yes. Okay, well, then that's not I mean, I guess gems pics are usually expensive and
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  $400 looking at now $500
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  No, no, there's three models 600 I
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  like reading the
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  ticker like going up.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  Which is 600
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Yeah, but that you don't need that one. Which one do I need? Get the regular g three which is?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Whoa.
  
  Wow, that's fair. That's fair.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I definitely have picked the foam roller. That's why I was curious.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  Like I told you because it is expensive. All right. I think it's like
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  yeah, anyways, That's it. That's your pick. Good. That's awesome. Stacy, what do you have for us?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
  Three picks. The first one, hopefully I'm not taking anybody's pick but Code for America. It's a great organization. There's lots of ways for you to get involved. So maybe, maybe we'll talk more about that. Two picks outside of that, that are the normal music picks. The first one is a song called Wild by tourists. Shout out to my friend David who shared this track with me. I'll read a quote to describe the song wild sits somewhere between Jamie xx and bone of air with its reminiscent elements of heavy heavy sense, an earthy bass bringing a solid ambient house feel so check that out. And then the second one is radical by Amtrak, and totally enormous extinct dinosaurs, which is the best name ever for an act. soulful, nostalgic, charming, vocal presence was a description that I wrote about that and both of those are a good little bit of a vocal presence in both of those, so maybe not the best For coding, but also very enjoyable.

  Hey, so listen to vocals code it's not that hard. Sarah already have.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  So I will not gonna lie one of mine was Code for America. The second one is also kind of expensive. It's Pat McGrath labs because I not only care about civic hacking, I also love makeup and it's okay to like both. So that is what I'm what is on my eyes right now today. And I think it's important for everyone to know that
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  right on
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  nice. Yes, this what do you have?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  What do I have? Well, so my first pick is a coffee shop called devotion coffee, um, specifically the one in Williamsburg in Brooklyn. They have a really, really beautiful, like coffee shop. It's like a wall of like nature and it's just like really nice setup. It's a little out there. I went to New York over the holiday. So I was like, exploring coffee shops. And that one was like really cool. So I think if you have time, you should check it out. And then I think we talked a little bit about it, but data.gov has like an incredible, incredible like library of data sets. And, you know, civic hacking, like kind of what I mentioned, you don't have to necessarily hack. I see a lot of people on subreddit for data visualization, they create these amazing visualizations and just like, showcasing problems from data, like it just helping with that I really starts the conversation. And that's really where the first step begins. So definitely check it out. And if you're into data or data visualization, I heavily recommend like digging in there and stuff. Jim, what do you have

  to start with my Valley silicon pick segment, things that are just ridiculous expenses only this because we have too much money. The question for the for the group, how much would you spend on a water bottle? This is a container that contains water that you can drink out
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  what are the features of this watermelon dollars.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I'm on board, I'm saying about a 10 to 30
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  10 to 30
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  It actually keeps my are cold for a long time.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Yeah, there is 40 4040 Okay, well, I think 30 wait Jim. Is it Wi Fi enabled?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  It is okay to for real. What is your tracks
  
  how much water you drink in a day? Why do I need to know that? How
  
  that's why it's probably still Valley silicon pick it is the hydrate spark that is filled with an eye it is a $60 water bottle but the features that keep track of how much water you drink were so Silicon Valley were like $60 for a water bottle. I'll take it 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  No, because if you just pour water out, it wouldn't
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  only deceive yourself.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  interesting interesting product doesn't
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  chastise you if you don't drink enough water. I think it does.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  robot voice. I don't know that.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Might maybe you are paying if you were honestly wanting to drink more water, which is very healthy. You should drink water as we are drinking alcoholic beverages right now. offset
  
  with some water ah true fair Mars has a water bottle How much does that water bottle
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  filled with alcohol it would be like drink more water like oh yeah sure
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  that is true it doesn't it doesn't know that it's water
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  there was a cup A few years ago I don't know if you'll remember it was called vessel track like the actual contents of the liquid that you were drinking and like the color contents and all that what
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  how so it tells you if you have a problem or not, I
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  think so. It didn't go anywhere. It's
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  one judgment from a 
  
  Could it detect poison? That'd be pretty cool.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  Augustus, how many times you drinking poison?
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
  Well, I don't know. It's like, you know, like if I was a king and then someone you know, snuck down.
  
  I can make a dripping sound. Do not drink. Like do not drink as poison now like,
  
  oh, wow, thank you. All right.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  I guess this has different problems and all of us, but I love it.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  We're Billion Dollar Startup. Anyways, as always, if you want to us to critique this live send us free samples and Maurice will review this for us and tell us like, yeah, oh, you obviously.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
  It'd be way more because the valley silicon pick, 
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
  it's still $60 for something that just holds water. I don't know if it qualifies.
  
  Yeah, anyways, Telly silica good times. Ah, my TV pick is Messiah season one on Netflix. It like sucks you in it's a show about there may or may not be the next coming of Jesus Christ. Well, they don't actually say that. They say Messiah, but it just keeps going. It's like homeland but better. And you'll you'll binge it really quickly because you're like, oh, what's gonna happen? What's gonna happen? I recommend it. I went
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
  into it thinking it was like, maybe not gonna be that good, but I definitely got sucked in. I think you hit that really, really well. Good pick. My two picks have nothing to do with civic hacking. I was a big fan of the you season. One so good you season two. I didn't expect it to be that great. I was kind of like, yeah, there's no way you guys can follow up with this. It was awesome. I really enjoyed it. And then another one. I'm gonna say I really liked it. It wasn't the best show. I mean, it wasn't the best well done maybe. But it's a true story or based on a true story. It's called dirty john. I highly recommend going to check it out. It's, it's just interesting on how it plays out. I liked it was good. So highly recommend that one too. Before we end the episode. I want to thank Sarah, thank you so much for joining us. It was great talking with you about civic hacking, working people get in touch with you.
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sarah Yu</strong><br />
  Yeah, so I'm not on Twitter. One of the reasons why I like to work on the Civic Hacking project is like so I can show what I care about without posting it online. But I have my email address, like on my GitHub profile, you can definitely reach me there. I like to have like one on one conversations. So you can definitely talk to me there if you are interested. I am also on LinkedIn. Those are the two best avenues to talk with me. So
  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
