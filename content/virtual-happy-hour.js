          <h2 id="heading">We'll be hosting our very first live Virtual Happy Hour!</h2>
          <p>Ever since COVID-19 has taken effect, we've been doing our podcasts online. With our <a href="https://twitter.com/FrontEndHH/status/1245381749435228161">100th episode coming out soon</a>, we thought it would be nice to hear from the listeners (and share drinks with all of you too!).</p>
          <p>Please join us on Thursday, April 16th at 8:00 PM PST on <a href="https://twitch.tv/frontendhappyhour">Twitch</a>. </p>
          
          <p>We hope to see you there! And remember to stay safe.</p>
          
          <p>Thanks for joining us for the Front End Virtual Happy Hour! We’re excited to have you join :) We’ll be hosting an AMA (Ask me Anything) live session on <a href="https://twitch.tv/frontendhappyhour">twitch.tv/frontendhappyhour</a> on Thursday, April 16th at 8:00 PM PST.</p>

          <p>If you’d like to ask questions, simply create an account on Twitch to participate in the chat! You may also tweet us <a href="https://twitter.com/frontendhh">@FrontendHH</p> if you have any questions you want to ask and we’ll try our best to get to them.</p>
          <h2 id="heading">What to expect</h2>
          <p>We’ll be streaming ourselves live (with drinks!) for a special episode to celebrate our recent 100th episode. After every year, we like to reflect on all the things that have happened and we can’t do that without you. Feel free to use the chat as a way to connect with other listeners as well :)</p> 

          <p>We’ll be moderating the chat lightly but please be courteous to others while in the chat. Most importantly remember to have fun!</p>

          <p>Look forward to seeing you!</p>
