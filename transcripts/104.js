Hello front end happier listeners. We will not be releasing an episode this week. This is a very challenging time. I'm personally finding it difficult to process everything that is going on and I don't feel it is time for us to be talking about tech. Instead of listening to the episode of Front End happy hour this week, I'd encourage you to use the hour to listen to watch and read educational materials about the long history of structural racism and injustice that black people have and continue to face as well as learn how you can be actively anti racist to affect real change. In our show notes, we've provided a list of picks that includes podcasts, videos, books, and articles available for you to learn more. Simply put BlackLivesMatter tweet at us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/frontendhh">@frontendhh</a> to let us know which resources you found useful. We'd also love for you to share additional resources that you've found valuable. Thank you all for being amazing listeners. And please let us know if there are things we can be doing better

</p>
