<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Welcome to the 19th episode of the front end, happy hour. In this episode, we're joined by Darren Buckner, founder and CEO of WorkFrom and Sarah showers from LinkedIn. They will both be joining us in this episode to talk about the pros and cons of remote working. Darrin and Sarah, can you give us a brief introduction of who you are, what you do, and what your favorite Happy Hour beverages,

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
that's awesome be on the show. And so my background is in software, been a front end developer for about 10 years. Prior to work from this I still do front of development with work from but clearly I probably have a lot of other responsibilities now, as you mentioned, CEO, so I see myself as being the chief evangelist, if you will, I'm the person who make sure that we win. And that's really my most most conservative focus. I spend a lot of time talking to people making connections, partnerships, and generally getting work from in front of as many folks as I possibly can. Favorite Happy Hour beverage so I I'd have to say it's either going to be Scotch or gin tonic, and it's usually sapphire, Safar tonic, or a scotch. And, um, my preference is you the Highland or an IRA.

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Showers</strong><br />
So I am a UI engineer at LinkedIn. On a prior episode, you may have known me as Sarah shares of Apple that is no longer the case. How long

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
have you been at LinkedIn now?

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Showers</strong><br />
Since June, so it's still relatively new, but so far, great experience

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
and see Microsoft. Apple, the LinkedIn to Microsoft's

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Showers</strong><br />
favorite happier beverage. Currently, I'm on old fashions right now. I'm still trying to find the whiskey of my dreams. old fashions are helping me get there.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Right on. Let's also go around the table and give a brief introduction of the episodes panelists. Augustus you want to start?

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, sure. My name is I guess this year and I'm a front end engineer at Evernote.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
My name is Jem Young, Senior Software Engineer at Netflix.

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
I'm Derek showers Senior Software Engineer at LinkedIn.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I'm Brian Holt, and they have not forced me to work remotely from Netflix yet.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You still have a desk there.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
As far as I know.

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Federman</strong><br />
Sarah, I'm Sarah, and I'm also a UI engineer at LinkedIn.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix and each episode of the front end Happy Hour podcast. We like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all, in the episode, we'll all take a drink. What did we decide today's keyword is Wi Fi Wi Fi. So anytime we say the word Wi Fi, we will all

</p>
<p><strong>All</strong><br />
take a drink. Cheers, cheers.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
So to start off the episode, I'd like to understand what is your experience been working remotely compared to a physical office? I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on that.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Yes, I can start. So I worked remotely for the past 10 days out of Salt Lake City, mostly just cuz I wanted to go back to Salt Lake City, shout out to Utah. But I actually got more done. Let's rephrase that I was very productive in time that I had in terms of I had a lot of productive time, I didn't get much done because my project was hard. The being under uninterrupted was really nice. Yeah, just being like the only person that working on that project was out for me ended up being really, really productive. I worked out of a co working space called Impact up in downtown Salt Lake. So it was it was fun to do a change of scenery, I would highly suggest like a little hiatus for anyone that has a company that would allow that.

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
So I think like one of the things that I've I've only do it here and there, you know, like a work from home day or work from coffee shop day, but never actually done it full time. But I'm curious, like I've heard that some of the biggest challenges, I think are and talk about some of the issues later. But like, it's just that natural conversation that you tend to have in an office environment. You know, you walk by somebody's desk and you're like, Hey, what are you working on? You know, and then you kind of like get these like natural conversations that are really hard to do on means like Slack and whatever like team collaboration tool that you're using. So I'm just curious if you had

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, I think I've experienced that I did about a year and a half working from home and it was great. Like I was working remotely the agency was like on the other side of Canada and so I worked for Yeah, that year and a half there was like some benefits to it like you didn't have to wear pants like that is great.

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
It's not getting dressed part is actually a big bet. It is a big benefit.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It's pretty nice. Like you can even be talking on a Skype or hangout and you don't necessarily have to wearing pants. No one knows I appreciate wearing pants. I do wear pants now.

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
We call that the business top. Exactly. I did find

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
all agree with Brian, I was very productive, you don't get a lot of interruptions, you have really heads down time, there's no distractions, anything like that going on. I loved having my dog with me all the time. Like he was just like, always come sit beside me while I was working. The no commute was great. But overall, I didn't like it. After a while it felt very isolating. You're, you're just by yourself, there's no one to talk to all you're doing is talking to people over messengers and like or slack, whatever it is, at that time, it was messenger. Yeah, I don't know, I felt like I wasn't able to have those good conversations with other engineers. And I didn't feel like I was growing. I felt like there's a lot of like, when you're interacting with other engineers and being able to talk in person, I think there's a lot of value in that. Well,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I think, just to add in real quick, that's really a work from home problem, right. Like, like, for me, I didn't really experience that quite as much because I was in a co working space. So like, there was a YC Y Combinator startup right next to me that I was able to talk to their engineers and hang out,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think that was my mistake is what I should have done, instead of building a home office is I should have actually just paid for cloud space, or just fine workspaces that are just outside of the home. So that gets you out of the you had stopped to put pants on. But,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I mean, depends on what country you're in. Look,

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
I love this conversation already. Because I think you're highlighting a lot of the things that that should be highlighted. So Brian, you're talking about being able to be in a space you wanted to be, but yet not have to walk away from work, right, you can still do it. So it allows you to have the affordance for you to be somewhere and still do what you want to really craft your day your life around work, or you can be your work around your life versus your life around work. And Ryan, you're talking about, you know, I've got my dog with me, like, I've got the ability to, to have the upside of not, you know, putting pants on. So it's clear the upsides usually surface immediately, like you see all those things. And what I think working remotely is really about is it's it's the, the ability to craft your day, in a way that's much more responsive to a lot how a lot of us live, right? So it's it's making those choices, being able to do that without having to time box, what is supposed to be your productivity, what is supposed to be the time that you're being, you know, you're doing your job, so to speak. And so I work remotely, I'm a longtime remote worker, and one of the things that I found is that it was really hard for me to not have the kind of 9pm brainstorm, we're all a sudden, I got it, you know, and a lot of us, you know, all of us are developers. And so you understand, like, sometimes you're working on this thing, and then all sudden you get in the moment, and you're not at work, you know, it happens sometimes. And so having the ability to go with that when I wanted to and not have to force it at 9am has been huge, you know. So it's really about, I think, the affordances, that you have to craft your day in a responsive way to how a lot of us live these days, whenever you're productive, you just go to work. And that's why the productivity bonuses are really they come through, right, because you see, you're able to do it when it's it's on your own terms, you know, and you can be productive of the times and the places that are best for you, you also talk to Brian about getting out of the house. And I think the variety is super key, you went to a co working space, that's huge, like you can get some of the community there, a lot of things we're working on with work for him is being able to provide that community experience from afar or in person, you know, those are, those are the kind of things and so it's still a lot, it's kind of the Wild West in some ways still. And so a lot of these things are being discovered and worked out. But I love the liberties. I love the affordances I love the fact that everybody at this table in that role could could create the day that they want, you know, that works for them.

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
I think that's a really excellent point. Because I think like, even if you have a flexible work schedule, which I think all of us in this room have somewhat of a flexible work schedule, but still, it's still like you have you have to be in the office, you know, usually like between that nine to five for meetings or whatever it might be available, whatever. Whereas I guess you do it sometimes with remote work to write because there's everyone, but I guess I guess like the point I'm trying to make is that there are some times where I wish that you know, I'm sitting at my desk like I'm just not productive, right? I'm just going to go read stuff or, or, you know, look at my screen, close my eyes and sleep Nice. Well, you end up working a lot more, right? Because you're you're working, you know, and maybe being distracted for let's say, 25% of your workday. And then you get home and like, again, with the nine 9pm idea.

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
That's the thing I found that I was working. I was working 12 hours. Now I wasn't productive for 12 hours, but I was working literally on the clock so to speak, because I would I would come home and then I would continue to work, you know. And so it does when you have to tie or when you're expected to timebox your productivity it just it creates some experiences that I think are not optimal for getting the most productivity and really the the balance and the happiness and the other things like your dog is very important. You know like it's good for you to be around him or her you know more often Right. And you might be inspired by that when you go to when you go to Salt Lake City and, you know, a change of scenery and just like the air out like that stuff can inspire you in a way that that might unblock you from something that you were, you know, working on. I mean, I think those things are really important. And so I think the, the variety, the flexibility, all those things are just certainly what I think should be fundamental to,

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Federman</strong><br />
I really love the freedom of it just like, it's kind of like when you get into an airport, and you're in a completely new place, and you have all of these possibilities, like, where am I going to go during this like break? Can I go to this coffee shop down the street? Am I going to stay home and do laundry? Am I gonna put pants on at all like, I love being able to work from an office when I feel like going to an office and talking to people, and also working from home when I feel like working where there's

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Wi Fi? Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Showers</strong><br />
My experience in a former life I, I was a technical writer for Disney. And I worked from home on the East Coast. And I reported to a team actually in California. So I'm curious what other people's experiences have been with remote working and different time zones and how you kind of balanced that because meetings get scheduled outside of like, your time boxed workday, that kind of stuff.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Even for me, it was in a different time zone, I kind of liked it, because I was ahead. So I would get up and not be interrupted for like a good two, I think it was like two or three hours time difference. And so they were all waking up and I'm like, ready for lunch. And so I was already ahead of the day. So I felt that was really impactful. I think sometimes we I've even worked with people that are in Europe, and we're in the US. And I think having the complete different shift in time. Like we're, they're going to go into sleep when you're waking up is really kind of cool. If you're especially if you're doing development, if there's bugs or something they're like tackling them while you're sleeping, and then you're tackling the other piece while they're sleeping. And it's kind of cool in that way too.

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
Yeah, that's, that's very interesting. I think it's a, it's certainly a business decision to be able to have teams located in different time zones as well. Right. Like, that's, that's good for business. I mean, so having somebody like you're sending ahead of ahead of others, gives you coverage in a very unique way. There are there are real challenges, having crossover, when people are on such different time zones, when it's a 10 hour or 12 You know that that's, that's really tough. And typically, somebody is kind of finishing their day and somebody starting today, and that can create some interesting challenges as well. Because you know, you're different in the beginning than you are at the end of your day. But I think so one of the things that we've done, in that I've done with several teams, where I've worked this way is just make sure that you have some sort of common across our crossover, you know, some some time where there is, you generally know that that everybody will be mostly available, you know, if you need them, so that you don't have that lag of a whole day in between or what feels like a whole day in between, you know, you put a put a question out there and you don't get an answer for, you know, another 12 hours kind of

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
thing. Like that's the toughest part is like if I have like a blocking problem, but I'm working with someone in Berlin, right? Like, either they have to get up or I have to get up early, like there are certain problems that you just need cooperation with. And I feel like that's, that can be a real problem.

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
Yeah, the real time, real time collaboration can can be challenged with, with remote work, it's very interesting that several of us have also mentioned in various ways, the interruptions that happen in office, and very much for a lot of us the experience of working around other people is kind of an interruption. You know, it's kind of a negative connotation, like I could I could be doing something but I'm being interrupted. That's a phenomenon that happens in other ways. When you're working remotely. I see it a lot now with the acceleration of things like Slack, you know, like now the interruptions are just different. They're still there in some ways you can ignore them. You know, to a certain degree, it's harder to ignore somebody when they're standing over your shoulder asking a question versus pinging your slack.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
The flybys or the yeah, those are the worst. managers that do fly by managers do that all the time.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Worse. It's worse than losing Wi Fi.

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Federman</strong><br />
I have a habit of when I want to work remote, I take on like a freelance project. And it's usually a really self contained project where I can design and develop everything myself. And it usually doesn't push me that much technically. But it's pretty like easy job. And it's obviously good money and I could work at home. But I feel like it's harder when you have to work with a team versus when you're just kind of reporting to a client.

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Showers</strong><br />
I worked on a project last year again completely by coastal the client and the designer were in Philadelphia, I was out here and you know, he was winding up his business day and creating a new product for a new business. I was building their website, and he always wanted the meetings to be during my day and well I did became a conflict of interest then because I can't stop my page job to work on a freelance project. So there was communication issues, I would be getting home and it's nine o'clock there. And he wants to have a meeting and discuss like next steps. So that I think I've had more challenges, I guess with, with the whole meetings and things, both with that case, and with old world, Sarah, the technical writer being on a different coasts to everybody else.

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Yeah, I mean, this might just be me, but I personally hate you, I don't think I could work remotely. I'm one of those people who like, if I need to be in an environment where I see people working, and that makes me more productive. If I like work at home, I just see so many distractions, I see my gaming PC, which I worked on with my friend on to build I see my giant TV and stuff like I personally can't work without interaction, like I would probably need to work from a coffee shop also, like one of the things that I get kind of scared of like, when I was graduating from college, I was thinking about working, taking a remote job. I think one of the things that was kind of scary for me was kind of career growth and like being able to like make it make a network and like meet people and make connections because I feel that's like a huge barrier for people who work remotely like they don't get that same interaction aspect. I don't know if you guys have thoughts on that?

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
Well, I've got tons. Not Not surprisingly, right. So, you know, look, we've we've spent the better part of 150 years creating in office norms. So we there are a lot of things that have come out of working in a single place as a group, initially, the office became very popular because the cost of exchanging information was quite high. So you wanted people next to each other. Right now technology in our world, right now, technology has really removed the cost of information, information exchange is almost instant. So you don't need to be next to each other anymore in those ways. But what came along with being near others was a whole social layer, that evolved out of that happy hours came from the fact that you were going to be ending work day collectively, at a certain time, the whole notion of a rush hour didn't exist when you didn't have to rush to or from somewhere. So there's a lot of infrastructure, a lot of cultural norms that have come out of the in office experience. And, and I think what we're what we are all exploring here today is those norms aren't well formed yet for what is this new way of working, and we call it remote working, and telecommuting, there's all these different labels, I tend to think it's really just professionals, knowledge workers, you know, ultimately, your work can because of technology in many ways, because of how ubiquitous Wi Fi is becoming churches, and other technologies, you can, and therefore many of us will be able to work from anywhere, right. And so when I think about remote work, there's certainly a, I think a well defined is your is your HR sort of label that you are not in office, or that you're out of office often. But for many of us, it's it's also just the fact that our work can can go with us. And if we are the type that will engage, then those boundaries are, are not well formed, norms are not well formed, but they're, they're coming, you know, and, and we're talking about a lot of this, and that the social, the social impact is real, go into a coffee shop is what that's why any coffee shop, we walk around here, and you know, we'll see people out there, what it's because they're getting some of that social influence, not necessarily talking to folks, not necessarily

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
being around people, I think it does pay, like it's a big thing. And in

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
the variety, again, I'll keep coming back to it. But the variety is key, being able to have that day at home where maybe you just need that focus, it's nobody's around. But then the next day or you know, several days later, being able to be around the more social aspect of things, the buzz, you know, then maybe being able to travel a little bit gets get away from some of the things and feel productive in that effort. You know, it's just just a variety, I think, I think trying to box this into its office or not office is is is fundamentally flawed. You know, that's, it's really are we becoming a much more distributed a much more mobile person? Absolutely. Right. And his information and our ability to do things much more portable. Yep. So what will come out of that is his these kinds of things right? And so,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
so I want to touch on one thing, you mentioned technology, and I think technology has gotten better. We have great tools. We have slack. Wi Fi is the technology good enough? I sometimes struggle I don't think we're quite there yet to be very remote and I'm interested in everyone's thoughts on that.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I think technology's pretty good so far, but specifically at Netflix, we have an amazing The like video conference system, and it's still not great. It's not the same as someone being in the room. And we haven't we haven't reached that technology point, you were like, oh, yeah, I feel like you're there. You're there.

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
I don't know if it's the technology, but I think it's maybe the way we interact with the technology sometimes like, so a good example of this is so at LinkedIn, we also have, especially in our new our newer offices, we also have every room is set up for video conferencing. And we tried to do a retrospective once and, you know, with a retrospective, you have like, people always kind of split up and we had like, people talk about, you know, the, the issues with the project that was just launched or whatever. And like, we did it on these, like, flip chart things, like kind of everyone wears into groups, and like, we had two people on video conference, and we realize that there's like really no way for them to participate. Because like, you know, it's like, yeah, it's just, and we didn't really think about it. And like, probably could have found a way if that would have been if we would have thought about that before like entering the retrospective, but it was just kind of like, like, we're kind of like, okay, well, you guys can discuss on Slack, and then kind of send your list and it was just like, awkward. And eventually, we just kind of gave up on the fact that. Yeah, you can get back to us later. Yeah, I was at

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Federman</strong><br />
a meeting yesterday, actually, with a bunch of people kind of brainstorming and there was one person that was remote. And we had a screen kind of like the one where that's actually in this room. It's, you know, a big screen. And there's eye tracking cameras, and it's kind of that eye level to the table. So it's kind of like, I feel like that format actually worked really well with them being able to be I mean, they're like a whole side of the room. Like you can't avoid them. Maybe Maybe if you had more than one person, it might be an issue. But I actually found it worked really well for us. Why do you have eye

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
tracking cameras?

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
They're creepy. I think they're soundtrack? Yeah, I think they are there.

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Federman</strong><br />
They move. Like when there's people around the table, it focuses on the person that's currently speaking. So the person that's remote is like talking to you,

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Showers</strong><br />
it's weird to get used,

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
it's really, I think the technology is certainly good enough, is it there's a real skill behind working like, the people have to also find ways to work more effectively when they are remote. So there's not, it's not one of those things where if you're just in an office, you just you leave and all of a sudden, you're just it's like the same skill set, like you do have to communication is the most important Friday. And it's a different kind of communication, because it's not a lot of times real time, it's you lose the context of being able to, you know, look at you and I or, or see if your body language is telling me something that, you know, your message isn't, those are skills that you have to you that you really have to learn if you're not well versed in it already. And so the technology helps it helps to augment those things, I think the fact that we are largely connected in enough ways, most of our business tasks, you know, that makes it possible, but, but it's still an art, like there's still skills that need to be, you know, that need to be meted learned and acquired and then ultimately honed in. So our team is entirely remote. Even though we're often in the same area, same city or even in the same neighborhood, we still are largely apart. Communication is it's like something that we have to continue to work on constantly, especially as you bring new folks into, you know, into the system, you got to figure out what are the nuances. You know, I can't necessarily hear or see you at times in ways that would have made it easier if we're in the same room. And so, so there's there is just I think there's a there's an onus on the person to ultimately figure out how to work well in that in that environment as

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
well. Yeah, it's just about the new people too, because it's like, even in my experience, anyway, even joining a new team, at a physical location at office is hard sometimes, right? Like, he's like, you know, you kind of sit next to somebody and you're still kind of like the outsider, because you know, he doesn't know you socially and

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
that you don't know the Wi Fi password.

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Showers</strong><br />
So since I started at LinkedIn, the UI engineers on my team, all live in San Francisco, as do I, but I have other commitments that require me to be on our Sunnyvale office. And so ramping up when the rest of my team isn't always in the same office space is actually been a challenge. It's really nice to be able to turn around and just ask a question to somebody. And so when they're not there, being able to verbalize what I'm trying to figure out and get a solution over slack isn't always a great solution to the point where I now actually work where they work just because it makes my life easier. And so the learning part of it as you do join a new team. That's been a challenge for me. Not truly remotely, but we're working, you know, miles apart different cities in the bay. It's been difficult. And so I'm wondering what other experiences people have had with that or if anyone has had to

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Federman</strong><br />
So playing off of what Sarah was saying I Think, especially when there's only one or two people on your team remote, and the rest are in one place. The people that are in one place need to be like briefed on how to deal with this I, I worked on a project where I was the only one remote. And I found that there were a ton of conversations that were happening without meetings casually without me. And every time we finally hopped on a camera and started talking, I was miles behind and I wasn't being included in the actual brainstorming. And if the group had like, actually set up meetings for all these things, instead of just chatting about it at the watering hole, or what do you

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
think that's more on them, though? I actually think it's more on you to try and find be creative. You're the one or two people you're out of the norm people to talk to you though, if they're not No, but I do think that it's a little more if there's only two people in the office, and there's like 10 people remote, I kind of feel like those two people have to figure out a way to work with

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
agree with that. I think that they're gonna have conversations, right? Yeah. And if they don't end up happening on Slack, and they just end up happening around their desks, and you have no idea that those conversations are happening.

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
But I think this is I think this is maybe one is what I was talking about earlier, I think this is maybe one of the things you don't get with remote workers. You know, we all, especially as engineers all hate that the interruption right like that. You're working on something and somebody comes over and grabs you, but how many times has that conversation actually turned into something very meaningful? A lot of times, right, like, at least for me is like at first I'm just like, I do not wanna have this conversation, I have to get this done by the end of the day. And this is like, very important. But after I after I get over that over that. It usually turns into a very meaningful conversation. It's usually just like, somebody come over, they had a quick thought. And, yeah, they could have that conversation on Slack. But it's just not as natural. And maybe, maybe that comes from being in an office environment. And you know, maybe if you're in the mindset of not in an office environment that happens differently, but it's just organic conversations that

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
if you and Brian, were having that conversation, and Sara's or Mo, how do you get her in that conversation? Like, I agree, it's hard for her to like, be like, Oh, Brian and Derek are talking. But I just feel like it kind of goes both ways. I think what would

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
happen in a real world situation is, somebody would say, oh, we should get we should get Sarah, I'm just using an example of we should get Sarah involved in this conversation on Slack. And then we just, you know, it's just a quick thought, like, nevermind, you know, like, I think we, but again, that is probably a factor of 95% of people being in an office and 5% of people being remote. If everyone in that company were remote, that probably would happen differently. But I think

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
that's it too, as I was thinking it was more like the she's like, it's two people that are separate. That's like not the norm. And so it's, they're not necessarily thinking of that person. So I think if you are remote, you have to try and be creative and like share, like, I don't know how to do it exactly. But try and go out of your way to like, get yourself in those conversation. Yeah, like

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
I've had this situation. Just recently, actually were coworker of mine, we were working on the same project. And he was in Utah and Utah. And good Wi Fi. Yeah. And so like, I would have a lot of conversations kind of on his behalf. And, you know, I would always like go back and like kind of recap the conversations with him. But it was still different in that, like, he wasn't like part of that and maybe like, just creative thinking in the organic conversations.

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
I mean, why can't we have it all? So I, you know, I'm maybe I'm an idealist. But I think that so part of what's happening? Well, part of what we're talking about is really specific dynamic, where there are a majority of folks or at least a plurality of folks in in it in this space, and then others who are not. And that that that dichotomy creates some interesting dynamics, always, that creates more challenges than if A, for instance, a company was entirely or a team was entirely remote. Or if a team was entirely in one place, or you know. So those are things that are still being figured out. And it's it, I think it's part of that company's culture part of their process, I think the onus is on all of us. So we're a team, right? We should, we should be a team. So that means that Sarah's input is just as important as Jack's input. And if we are valuing Sara's input, like we should, then we are going to, we're going to go, we are going to go, we're going to do what it takes to get that input, right. And we're going to make sure that we mitigate some of these things that might run fast, because we happen to be co located that aren't to her benefit. So we're going to make sure that we're intentional and bring her in in certain ways. And we can build that into our process we can build into our culture, and it can work very well. There are a lot of companies who are entirely remote, and more and more so and those companies aren't having the same problems. Now, what they, what they are challenged with is how do we get people into the same place occasionally, so that some of the synergies that happen in a room that can happen from afar are still they're still part of what we're doing. So you see companies who are figuring out how to get people into the same space periodically. And for extended period of time where a lot of stuff really can happen. camaraderie and team building, all those things get harder. And I just sort of goes back to my earlier point where I think we're just still so New in the norms that we're creating around this that, you know, we're figuring out in real time. And we're all part of it, you know, but it's working. The the benefits, I think are clear and are important. The downsides are also very clear and important. And so we're starting to figure out, okay, how do we, how do we make it all work, how to reconcile at all.

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Federman</strong><br />
One thing I've noticed with companies that you know, have multiple offices or are completely distributed is that rather than getting people together in the same place to work, they more focused on getting people everyone together as a retreat and as like a team building exercise, like Mozilla rents out Disney World, like, Adobe, does retreats, like GitHub does it, everybody does it, and it's more about creating a culture than it is about getting work done.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I fully agree with that, I think and you've made that point as well, that working remotely its success or failure depends almost entirely on the culture of the company. GitHub is 75% of remote, and they think it's amazing company. But Netflix does not do remote engineering at all, because we feel that's not what our culture would you wouldn't get the culture if you're a remote engineer. And I think that's true. In all the incidents I've had working with remote engineers, it's the lot of the onus is on me, and I have to understand that like, culturally, I need to explain like our thought process, how we came to this, because everybody's right, we have those conversations, like, Hey, I got this, you know, don't do that thing. And it's on us to communicate that back to the remote workers. But again, that's cultural that's on me, there's no manager saying, Hey, make sure you loop everybody in,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
you have to build that culture. Exactly. It's deliberate to right like you, you're deliberately including people, you're deliberate, like you're deliberately building into that culture. Otherwise, it doesn't work. I feel like you and

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
I want to challenge to a certain degree, that kind of that that's not always a great thing to have part of your culture where there's a sort of the just, hey, when I'm when I'm feeling I want to just reach out and talk about something that I think it leads to those interruptions that we talked about, right. And so I think that being intentional, being deliberate, is not a bad thing, in this case, like, really thinking about, okay, what is it that's coming here, and if we can capture it in a way that can then persist, it's going to be important in a lot of ways, not just for the remote employees, but the fact that, you know, that persistent allows everybody on the team who's who might be in the same building, you know, just also weren't part of that conversation. Right. So it's not, I don't think it's a, the barriers are real, physical and otherwise, but I think if we, if we continue to think about them as being this barrier, then then we're going to get siloed. And some of these things, and I think the culture is very important, you know, I look a lot at the, the benefits of retention of folks, the happiness of folks, the health of folks, when they're able to really craft you know, their experience a bit more be more flexible, and don't have to be entirely remote. But you know, more flexibility, that's a big thing, you know, that's something you should want in your culture, life happens, life happens for a lot of people you should want to support that you should be able to, to move around as they need to and still be a contributing member of the team. Trying to, I think, to constrain that is I in some ways, fundamentally a problem, right? I mean, we really want, we believe in our people, we've hired folks for a reason, like they're there. But like we want, we want all of them in an almost complete fashion. And so we should be much more, I think, responsive to their ability to contribute. And always so

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I'm interested to in remote employees being paid. So I think that is like someone working in like Silicon Valley, it's very expensive to live here. The wages are better. But if you're if someone living maybe in Utah, Brian, like, if you're living in Utah, and you're working remotely there, how should your pay reflect that? Should it be the same as like, if you're working for a company located in California should be you be paid for the same as the employees that are at the office? Or should it be different,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I feel like it should be tied to the cost of Wi Fi.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I'm not a fan of remote work, that's just not my personality type I got face to face interaction to me can't be discounted. Some people can do it, just like some people can work in Open Office. Some people can just do you know, different strokes, different folks. But I think remote workers should be paid the same as people in the office because i As everybody knows, from the Silicon Valley upset, I'm not a fan of like the insane rents here. And thus the insane salaries. Like if someone's worth something, just pay them that wherever they live in the world, and like hopefully, over time, we just kind of equalize out rather than this cluster of high salaries. And then but some talented engineer in Des Moines doesn't get paid as much as me because they haven't delivered.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Well, they're delivering the same work to right like I think where we are, yeah, it's not value that you're in the office. It's value on the work that's actually being delivered.

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
Are we valuing your choice of how you live and your lifestyle or is it you know, and therefore our ability to help compensate for that? Or are we valuing the input the and the output, you know, that

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
isn't your salary? Sorry, I know you're just isn't your salary. I feel like your salary is based on the cost of living right so like just Like, there's you, you can live a lot better in Utah, making a Silicon Valley salary than you can, you know, making a good salary in Utah. And I think that's basically because it's based on the cost of living. It's not it's and and I think if you're working for a Silicon Valley company, they just don't know any better. I mean, I'm making them I guess I'm like making you mean, they know what they're paying, but they don't know any better. It's just that like, you're already making the salary. And this is what they pay an engineer. And it's not necessarily because it's like the talent of that engineer, it's just because that's what they would pay an engineer with that talent in San Francisco, when rent costs you this and food costs you this and it seems actually a little bit unfair. Somewhat, if an engineer Utah's making the same salary as I am unable to,

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
that's an interesting, I think, if so, it depends on sort of which way we're looking at this, if if somebody is living in an area that is disproportionately more expensive to live in than maybe others, are, we now really sort of adjusting for their experience, and ultimately, then raising the salary for others, because person who's in San Francisco or wherever it is, it's very high cost of living now is setting the standard, right. And so as a business owner, you know, I think about this a lot, you know, costs of running a business are very real, it's like, this is how you survive, you know, you want to have the best people. And of course, you want to be able to support those people. And the way you do that is through giving them money. And it's huge. Like, that's how you have to do it. But you should, if we are paying an engineer or a market or anybody who's working for us in a in an area where it's it's expensive to live, does that now raise the average for everybody else? That's that's not how we often look at a low you often look at it is, you are living in a place that is not as expensive to live. So we should lower potentially lower your salary or maybe not pay you as much. And it's because I think in business, we have a mindset of saving money cost cutting, you know, that kind of things.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
At the end of the day, I agree pragmatically with Derek that if you give me 100, can you tie live it like a king, if you give me 100k? Here in San Francisco, I rotten die. To another

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
point, though, if you were if you were to take a job in Utah, like some agency or whatever, right? And you were to say, Okay, I'm gonna move out to San Francisco. And I want the cost of living adjustment. Do you and they had no offices in San Francisco? Let's, let's make you know, I'm just foreigners. Would you think that they would pay you the adjustment?

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Yeah. I mean, this is obviously the ideal ad absurdum example, right, yes.

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
But it's like, I mean, everyone goes from Silicon Valley to other or valley, but like, you know, higher places to places that the average hour isn't as high. But the other way around, I think that it would be

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, and the company's not going to pay you more, they may like try and bump you up a bit, but you're leaving, were relocated. They're not going to pay.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I actually did this, like, raise your hand if you did this. Brian's raising his hand? Ah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
yeah. But that the company got you to move, though. That wasn't you didn't say, Hey, I'm gonna move or you don't have offices? Right. The company moved indoors. Yeah. So that's a little bit different, because

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
it is a little bit different.

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Federman</strong><br />
So I think it's a bit idealistic to think about a job based on the value that you're outputting. Because I mean, that's, I mean, if you really think about it, there are so many things that are actually affecting our salaries, and it's not value. It's the market. It's what people are getting paid right now for this job. How much demand and supply is there, it's not about what you put out on a daily basis. And I think that working at it like that is kind of, I mean, it's not going to really help anybody. I was talking to somebody who was looking at opportunities at Mozilla. And Mozilla has paid tears, which I thought was really interesting. They have a tear for the Bay Area, and then there's one for New York, Boston, Portland, whatever, big cities, and then there's one for everybody else, and everybody gets the same quality of living, but they're all on a tear that's right for them. And I mean, this person was really happy with the number they were given in their area. I mean, I if that works, go for it. I like that that

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
is actually a very good way to do it more about paying people for what they're worth then I heard because it's like I paid you know, I pay like $4,500 for ran out here I paid $1,300 for rent and pellet Philadelphia so I mean, that's a that's a huge difference in and rent that that if I were paid, you know, the the the same salary in Philadelphia, I would, I would live so much better. And it's not because I'm better what I do. I'm the same person but

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
you would live in Philadelphia. So that's, that's that's a trade off. Philadelphia.

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Federman</strong><br />
salary should match the quality of life across the board.

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
But what I think is hard is just an African we can move on but I think What's hard is that when you go remote for at least this is what happens at LinkedIn is when you go remote after you've worked here, it's really hard for a company to say okay, you're going to make less money now. Yeah, yeah, that's tough. That's really hard. It happens. And maybe it should, I actually think it should. But you know, you, oh, you've worked here for a couple years, like you get the privilege to kind of like, get what's just fine. But like, you know, and you're, and I think it'd be an awkward conversation, I

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
think it'd be fun to be totally. Right. Like, you get to move somewhere else like, I'm, and particularly I'm picturing moving from San Francisco to somewhere else is like, yeah, you're gonna pay me like 20%, less, less, but I'm gonna live like 50 times greater. So it's cool.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
And is the Wi Fi cheaper?

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I think so.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Last question for the episode I think could be an interesting one. Since we've kind of talked the pros and cons of remote working. If given the choice, not necessarily location or anything or pay, let's leave that off the table. If you had the choice, would you work remote or work in an office understand remote from 100% remote free? Absolutely. The freedom to choose

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
both the choices most important

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
choices? Good I don't disagree is neither I wouldn't

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
want to be forced to necessarily work remote. But personally, I'm much better when I have the choice to work when and where and how I want. It's just I know that about myself, it's a play to my strengths. And that's one of my strengths. So if

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
you're at a company, and you could work from home, or work from a coffee shop, and go into the office some days and just be flexible that way, that's like the ideal

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
contract, I'd like to do that I'd likely go and be where I need to be based on what I feel like I need to at that moment, you know, that would be that's ideal.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
You know what I would love if this just occurred to me, for one, I'm an office person I, I like to look someone in the face and just kind of understand what they're all about. But what I would love is for a company to be like, Hey, take two weeks work remotely from Costa Rica or something like that something where it's like you're still working, but you're definitely in a different mindset than we currently do that now. It's like, go take vacation, but I wouldn't mind a company just like no go work remotely, get some empathy for the people in another country. But also take it easy, but keep doing your job. And like it builds up that culture of remote working, but also just helps you think differently about problem.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You know, what is interesting, I wouldn't call it necessarily remote work. But Evernote years ago used to actually encourage employees once a year to go work at one of the other offices, whether it be in like, I think what was it like Tokyo, there's like different places around the world, or Zurich, Switzerland. That's amazing. And so you would go and as long as you were there for a few weeks, like it had to be, I think at least two or three weeks that you were gone, you go work in that office, they would pay for the flights, they would pay for your stay and everything like that. And I thought that was an interesting way. It's like you're interacting with other people in the other offices, but you're also getting a change of space. I thought that was that's kind of cool. It's not really working remote, it kind of is from your local office. But you're now working with another

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
great idea. First of all the curses of worker mode are it helps you like understand if remote work is for you. But also it, it helps you understand the needs of users in other parts of the world, which is amazing. You get the spirit experience cultures, like I don't think there's any bad or that other than the expense. But I think the expense is paid.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It's so minimal. Like I think it's like even at Netflix, we do a lot of research where we'll send people to India, or like the when I first started there, I went to like Paris and London, and you're doing research there and you're able to grasp some of the culture there that you just can't you can read about but it's not the same. It's like you actually have to be there and experience it. So yeah, I think I like gems suggestion, actually, that's probably the best best of all worlds.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Well, you can probably get most companies that have unlimited PTO to let you go places, they probably won't maybe pay for your flights or accommodations. But like Netflix picked up the bill for my Wi Fi. Cheers. But I picked up the bill for like my co working space and a bunch of other stuff like that. So you probably can kind of like halfway do that, like I just worked during the week from Salt Lake. And it was just fine. I think

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
when we're talking about remote work or flexible worker, all of those things that we're really talking about how can we set people up to be the most successful that they possibly can be, and knowing that most things in life are hard to just say they all happen at this place at this time in these ways. And so I'm really looking forward to, you know, a future in where the labels start to start to melt away. And it really is just about how do we support people, you know, as sort of a base level, you know, and with work from my goal, my aspiration, my vision is that we create really a bedrock of support and opportunity for people to just do their best work. And certainly right now, that's we're focused on helping people do their best work when they are outside of an office. Because the office is the norm for most and is you know, it's it's something that's very well developed, but out but outside of it is kind of the wild west so but I just think that ultimately we got to get to a point where people are able to be supported and, and, and how they can be set up for the best success possible. All things rise with that. Businesses better people are better. You know, it's just we're going to be happier, healthier. That's I feel like where we're headed with a lot of this stuff. So a lot of these conversations, we're having a lot of consternation that we're feeling is, is us getting to that place where we're just being supported and doing our best work, whatever that means. And whenever that label, you know,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
ultimately, I think we should change it from working remotely to just work in flexible,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
flexible working. That's, that's brilliant, because the I worked for a company and they were, they were kind of old school. And this is a very pervasive thought that butts and seats equivalent to productivity and that is 100%. Not true. Like, Ryan knows I do my best work at HP. I like to in the morning watching TV, don't babysit. Exactly, yeah, you hired me as a fully formed adult. Trust me to get my work done when

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
you didn't hire to watch me you hired me for hopefully what I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
don't have time to watch Jem. Let's do much. Wrapping up the episode. What do we have for pic? I guess this? What do you have?

</p>
<p><strong>Augustus Yuan</strong><br />
Oh, yeah, sure. So um, I know, I'm actually like gem, I personally need that face to face interaction. But I do respect that some people like working remotely and they work better working remotely. There's this TED talk for one of my picks, which is called Why work doesn't happen at work. And this guy basically kind of talks about how there's so many distractions in the office. And it's a really, really awesome talk. So highly recommend checking that out. And the other pic I have is the Android 404 page. They like made a game. It's awesome. It's freaking cool. You should play it. It's a very big time waster. So if you didn't find your page, at least you found something else. I'll take up your time. So

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
my picks our first one is from Sarah Dresner, who we all know and love. She wrote a blog post on styling incident CSS, which is great Re and she talks about functional and object oriented programming and applies it to CSS, which is fantastic, fantastic way of thinking. And my next pick is Grim Dawn, I've been playing that's an action RPG. And it's a lot of fun. It's just kind of silly hack and slash kind of blow things up. But you know, we all need a break time. So,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Sarah, what do you have for us?

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Showers</strong><br />
So Derek and I have been using and contributing to work from for, I would say good 18 months now, we work remotely during the weekends around the city on various projects, work related or personal projects. So I have a couple of really good spots here in San Francisco. So workshop Cafe is a really awesome spot. It's in the financial district, they give you your first few hours for free. So you can go and check it out. And then they have like an hourly Wait, what's free Wi Fi. But they have food coffee boosts, which we all like here. The other spot we went to this weekend, which I really, really like is technically in the mission. It's kind of near Potrero Hill. It's called Coffee Bar. But it was really nice space. And one of the things you get with work from is they ask you to contribute as you find new spots, and it's number of outlets, Wi Fi. food options for drink options. So it's more than just like searching for workspaces, you can really find kind of what's important to you. And I do ask you to give back to that community because it's users that you say regularly,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
they don't care it

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Showers</strong><br />
so yeah, go work from work from is awesome. Thanks, Darren.

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
Thank you. Thank you.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Derek, what do you have for us first of all,

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
I got to give an honorable mention to work from as well because I met Darren through work from I didn't know him at all and found work from it because I was using Yelp to find places to work around San Francisco and like couldn't find anything through Yelp because like what is like I'm going to go there I don't know if they even have Wi Fi or whatever and I emailed Darren and I said this thing is awesome. I love your product and that's actually how we connected so I think it's a truly amazing product so definitely check it out but anyway my two actual picks are this article that was written by a friend of mine who works for LinkedIn and he just recently went remote and he works in a Mario or Amarillo I don't know how you pronounce it Texas Emeril is an unreal he wrote this really good article on which we'll link to and picks up on going remote and kind of like the problems not problems but like issues and just stuff he had to overcome with going remote. So it was a really good piece he actually just wrote this week I just found out about today. I pinged him I was like man I'm talking about

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
remote work he did he did he posted on LinkedIn Pulse, so no one called Pulse.

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
You're so funny Brian FOSS has done and my other pick is something new that Yelp introduced that I really like and usually they introduce features half ass and this is actually one of them because they don't have it on Web. They only have it on native clients but no, no it's it's called It's called Yelp collections. So you can actually take your bookmarks and organize them into collections. And then you can take your collections and get a map view of that collection. So it's really cool. Actually just used it for nothing. I don't use Workfront. But I just used it for coffee shops I like around the city, but like you use it for like, favorite burger places or whatever. And then you can share that collection with others. It's a really cool feature.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Awesome, Brian, what do you have?

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
My first one is a music pick since I seem to be going on this week. It's the band halos Hae Hello, there in London kind of synth pop group, which I discovered literally today. It's pretty great. And then my next two pics is Minnesota themed. First one is track J S, which is for tracking errors that you have on the client and in various other capacities thrown by the fantastic Todd Gardner, who has offered to sponsor us multiple times. I just wanted to give him a shot a shout out

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
how much did he pay you to say that non disclosed?

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Excellent. The third one is also self serving, which is I'm giving another friend and masters and so his gem for that matter. So check us out on front of masters coming up. So you're sooner than I am, right?

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Federman</strong><br />
Yes, I was at Johns workshop the first time he gave in and it was super good. So definitely check now it's gonna be on

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
front end masters immortalized forever.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah. Darrin, what do you have for us?

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
I have to plug some things that I think are super appropriate. So definitely, I want to plug both Sarah and Derek because what they what they just told you I think is the core of what we are doing at work from which is helping each other. work better in this way. Since it is still such a such an early thing for a lot of us. It is something that is still developing the domain knowledge that we all have a super, super key. And I think that the one has the power to affect the money. And in certainly the case for a long time. So your support over the last 18 months has been huge for us and certainly something that is not lost on us. The second the second pic that I'd have is for Friday, happy hour because this is amazing. But no, this is amazing. I you certainly all very amazing people, I had high expectations, and you've certainly just blown those out of the water. Now I'm just now I'm bummed that I'm hopefully you'll invite me back because this is this is amazing. I'd love I'd love to be part of it in the future. So some really good stuff going on here. And I think it'll be very helpful for a lot of people. No, no, it already is. So congratulations on that. I'm super into this right now. So TV show Westworld. It's all the things right now for me, you know, hashtag

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
hashtag New Game of Thrones

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
throws, but Westworld all the things I love it. And certainly look forward to it every week. So that's, that's awesome. And the last one is kind of his productivity. So I'm a bit of a tab hoarder. So if you look at my machine right now has opened, you look at it, you'd see literally probably four to five windows, each with about 30 to 40. tabs open. It's ridiculous. Now Chrome, Chrome doesn't handle this. Well, it's a suck. You know, it's bad. But But I found I found this this amazing little Chrome extension called Toby which which there are others who have tried to do this. But Toby to be why I think it is. I think it's done this in a really well elegant way. But they allow you to sort of organize your tabs. And in a way that is that is very good for me gives me this kind of visual workflow. Since I spent a lot of time doing a lot of things in the browser. This is this has been like a game changer for me a lot of ways. So if you haven't checked it out, this is a little Chrome extension called Toby, to eBay belief. And it's a it's super helpful, especially if you're a tab hoarder like me. But it was really actually actually excellent article, that blog post came out today from Trello. About the 10 myths around remote working, I think it's very relevant to a lot of things we've talked about today. So if you read that it's very well formed, it's got a lot of great information, I think, really accurate. So take a look at that. If you're curious about it. If you're thinking about some of these challenges, and some of the myths that you you may be thinking are the downside or the upside, you know, it's really well done. It's on Trello as they just I think they read the blog today,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Sarah, what do you have?

</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Federman</strong><br />
So my first pick is actually something different. I kind of I have weird fantasies about dropping everything and go living remote for a year or two. Like that is my weird dream. But there was this indie hackers article and indie hackers is I don't know if it's been a pig before, but it's a group of like, how startups got started, how they got funding, how they grew, what their revenue is, and where they came from that and there's this one called Nomad list, which is specifically for digital nomads, people who travel and work remotely. And it's a list of all these cities and all of these attributes that kind of can. You can filter and like if it's like a safe city, like a city with less smog, is it female friendly and price range of living there? It's it's really, really, really Awesome. And it talks about how this Nomad list grew from just a spreadsheet that somebody had and there was demand for it. So he made it into a real site. And now they have job listings remote jobs. So that's also a good place to look at. The second one is actually a company I used to work for look think they're a super awesome agency in DC, they do a lot of cool design and development work. They published an article about working with their remote dads and how they deal with it and what their best practices are. So super cool article, they just redid their site. And that's really awesome. So take a look at it.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Alright, so

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
for my two picks I have they're kind of both somewhat security related, but there's a smack extension called oversight. It's a replacement for anyone who tapes their webcam, and you know, I don't know like they've even I've seen articles even like, quoting that Mark Zuckerberg does, this is like people are scared that their webcam is going to turn on while there's a little Mac extension called oversight. And it's constantly running in the background and checking for anything unusual and will flag if someone's trying to access your webcam or your microphone. So it will shut it down and allows you to like stop that from happening.

</p>
<p><strong>Derrick Showers</strong><br />
If you don't think it's important, watch the third episode of Black Mirror.

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
Gonna go? Right, yeah, I was gonna go

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
there. Thanks. And then my second pick is a book it's actually called How to open locks within improvise tools. It's actually like it shows you how to break into things open doorknobs, deadbolt, locks, cars, whatever it is. But if you think of it, it's almost a way to protect yourself is like looking how easy or vulnerable for certain things in your house or your car. And you can kind of think about those things and maybe prevent them from happening. So it's a very small book, actually, an engineer at Netflix had shown me it and yeah, I started reading it's a it's a good book. It's on Amazon. I will definitely put a link to it. Alright, so thank you both Darren and Sarah, for joining us on today's episode is great having you as guests. Where can people get in touch with you, Darren?

</p>
<p><strong>Darren Buckner</strong><br />
Well, so you can find work from work from CO at work from on all the things and you can find me personally, Darren at work from Dotco I try to respond to everything. It's super important that I do hear from you. Also at Darren Buckner on Twitter and Instagram.
