<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Welcome to the 24th episode of the front end, happy hour. It's the very first episode of 2017. And we're all really excited for a brand new year of interesting topics and discussions. To kick off the new year we'll be discussing the trends that happened in 2016. In this episode, we discuss and share our opinions of things that have happened to the front end community over the past year. Before we get started, let's go around the table and introduce today's panelists. Maurice, you want to start off? Sure.


<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Hi, I'm Mars Jullian. I'm a senior front end engineer at Netflix.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I'm Brian Holt, and I luckily wasn't fired in 2016. Jem Young

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Senior Software Engineer at Netflix, Stacy London

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
front end dev at Atlassian.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
I'm writing glum. I'm a front end engineer at Netflix. anymore. We're software engineers. Now. I'm a front end software engineer.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You can call yourself whatever you want. And I'm Ryan Burgess. I'm a software engineering manager at Netflix. In each episode of the front end, Happy Hour podcast, we like to choose a keyword that if it's mentioned at all, in the episode, we will all take a drink. What did we decide today's episode, top keyword is trends, trends. So if any of us say the word trends, we will all take a drink. All right, well, let's get started. I would love to hear what are some notable things that happened in 2016.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
So I think the first thing that comes to mind for me is that we finally started questioning react a little bit and we started looking at other alternatives, things like pre act started coming into play a little bit, Vue js and a whole other host of kind of things that are making us look at just pulling in react as a default framework for front end projects. I think that was a huge thing that started happening and towards the end of 2016.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, I think that's a really interesting one. And like you have another one that I just learned about, actually, this year was Inferno I, but I think that was around in 2016, as well.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Well, you have to question why both periactin and Furnell came up, right. And I think it's indicative of a larger trend cheers. That we're starting to give a shit more about developing countries, places with poor mobile places with poor internet connectivity. And React is not a small library. It's 45 kilobytes when you use it, but minify. And I did the math, because I just gave a talk about it. That's like two seconds, just downloading your framework. And that sucks on T and 2g that is, which is pretty slow. But even still, two seconds downloading a framework to serious bummer.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's a no code either. That

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
is just the just the framework, right? And so at this point, we're kind of starting questions like, Are we getting two seconds worth of productivity out of this? And my argument is, like, not much is worth two seconds. Right? That's battery. That's data. That's a whole bunch of things that you just can't afford to give up. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think actually, watching your presentation I found really interesting was the size of other frameworks as well. Angular and Ember were both 111 or 110 kilobytes, and 11 112. And that's nine seconds,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
nine seconds on a 2g, 2g network. That's insane. It's crazy. And so that's why Preact that's why Inferno are kind of coming in, say, like, cool, I'm going to be a half second on 2g, right? That's what React is. And that's, like, you still get most of your React comforts, you still get really fast renderings, and good enough renderings on things like, you know, a crappy phone. And so I think that's, that's where these this questioning of React is coming from. I'd also like it bears mentioning that I think React is going to get better. They just hired the guy that didn't Furneaux to work on React itself. So they're definitely thinking about it for sure.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
So unrelated to that. A notable thing that I saw happening was the move of a lot of engineers away from startups into bigger corporations actually, you know, there's a lot of the bubbles bursting, blah, blah. But I think a lot of people saw that most startups aren't gonna make you rich and there's sometimes more logic and just working for your corporation and learning something and having the perks and benefits Yeah, you don't get that we could be millionaires but you're not gonna be a millionaire anyways, like I but I think we're all starting to realize I like that the hype is over, we're starting to kind of level out a bit more

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
is we'd rather have real stock then stock that may pay us off later. Is that where you're getting that? Or?

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Yeah, well, I think like at least from what I've seen, even like some of those startups that do pan out like box for example, right? They didn't really pan out huge even for the early people investment and box like hit it is pretty big, right? Like big enough. I like we've all heard of box, right? They IPO and everything like that. And there's an article out from one of the developers that worked there and he basically got his money back that he would have made it a big corporation. So he took a ton of risk by not working in a big corporation and he basically his panning out was that he made his money back, right? I'm not trashing unbox. Like I don't actually really understand too much the economics about it, but just the the reality of that situation kind of sucks,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
but it's happening more and more like we see many unicorns I'm doing air quotes where people can get a mic.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Everyone's cringing

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, sound like dreams.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
2015 was like, that's all you heard. Like, Slack said a billion Theranos is like way over a billion Palantir all these companies like go work for them, you'll get rich and then 2016 They all tanked. They all tank laying off people, things like that. And I don't know, we're, we're kind of sick of playing the lottery. Now. He's won like a stable job. Maybe it's just the the communities getting older, more mature. Maybe it's just my circle of friends? I don't know.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Yeah, that could be it, too. It's just who we're talking to more often. Yeah, because the startups are still finding people to work there. So it might be also attracting new talent from other places, other than Silicon Valley, the at

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
least the recruiters that send me messages and that I talked to they're, they're giving better salaries and less equity. Right. And I think that's just kind of coming around as well.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think there we also saw some things that were released this past year in 2016, one that I was super stoked on I'm sure others can agree with yarn yarn was really cool. Something that I never would have expected, it was something that kind of just came out of nowhere.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
And for being so new, it's at, we're using it at Atlassian on the on product that I'm working on. And the speed is phenomenal. Like the difference in just doing your install, when you're setting up your project is it's it's it's very noticeable.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I've just seen how easy it is to switch to yarn into like, just add it and you're pretty much done.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, there's like, they flip back and forth really easy. Like, yarn publish is actually having a lot of problems for us, like internally. But just flat back to NPM publish, it's no problem.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
That's awesome. My favorite thing about is it's deterministic. So you eliminate an entire class of problems just by saying like, no matter what state I'm in, right now, if I run yarn install, I'm gonna get the same product no matter what, I think that's a big deal.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Another big thing that was released was Angular 2.0. That was something that we'd heard about in like 2015. And I felt like it was never going to get released. And yes, it finally finally made the cut of 2016. Now we're talking about Angular four. from two to four. Well,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
how did we get from react point 14 to 15?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It just happened just happened? This happens. No, it's

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
awesome. It's cool. It's a cool framework. It's has lots of really cool features that I think are gonna push the web forward. But it's going back to what I was talking about earlier. It's a huge framework. It's heavy. Yeah. 110 kilobytes with without RX js, and they encourage you to include RX js, which brings it up to like 145.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Well, an RX js is fairly large. Yeah, it is just by itself. Most definitely. And we got our RxJS, five this year today. Yeah, we did, actually. And that's right,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
shut up and lash, it's actually brings up a trend cheers. That I want to talk about, I think this year in front end, or not in front end, but particularly JavaScript, we kind of learn to not fear the major version. Like I feel like before we were all like, the major versions, like a tire rewrite every single time. Right. And I feel like in 2016, you know, react jump to 15 I think that happened this year. Yeah, it did. Yeah, Angular is now moving from like, these huge releases to like, you know, Angular three, Angular four, those are kind of quickly follow. We moved away from this idea that major releases are, you know, big monstrosities and that that we're kind of more observing semver or semantic versioning. And it's okay, right, it's okay to bump the major version.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
What about trends that in 2016, that years? Cheers. Right, and the question. I know, we've mentioned some notable things that happen. But what are some things that I really liked?

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
That came out? Yeah. One thing I was gonna say is that I feel like Mozilla caught up this year I like I'm a big Firefox fanboy. Now. Like, I think it comes up on every episode of the podcast last couple of episodes in 2016. Yeah, definitely. It's a trend. Cheers. That was intentional. But I feel like they caught up this year, I feel like particularly with their multiprocess coming into to the stable version, to adding containers to a bunch of stuff that Mozilla is kind of like back on the viable browsers list. And that that was something made me really happy.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Also, the same thing was happening for Microsoft. Actually, they hired a lot of really smart people like Nolan Lawson really a dude, Rachel Nemours to Oh, yeah, a lot of really smart engineers. They're trying to revamp their image. They're talking about using chakra, which is their JavaScript engine in node instead of V eight, which I think it's fantastic. I definitely welcome innovation, the node and it's good to see they're pushing the envelope a little bit. They have ways to go but they're definitely making inroads and it's good because we don't want to Google being the dominant browser all the time because nobody wins. If that happens, definitely

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
Microsoft's definitely trending up, I think. Yeah, I mean, Microsoft code now is my Default Node debugger. Whenever I'm reading or writing node, I fire up Microsoft code and use as my debugger. So

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I'm glad Derek's not here to hear that.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It's too funny that we're talking about Microsoft is like a good thing. positive light. Yeah. Taking on Derek are working at Microsoft.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
I mean, before I ordered this, the new MacBook Pro, I seriously consider getting a surface Windows Surface Book. I even tried to get I ran on Windows 10 VM and tried to get my vim set up going in bash. does have a few too many problems. So when the time came, I still went with a Mac. But how are you feeling? Now? I don't hate this man.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I like it. Can we talk about Apple? No, yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
definitely could even talk about traffic onto the dislike, yeah, we could go talk about trends that we dislike, or we could finish.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
All the way from my apple round. One of the things that I liked a lot was seeing that a lot of the sort of new CSS frameworks that we can use, and that came out in 2015, are sort of starting being pieced together in 2016, in terms of people starting to have a conversation about how we can do our layouts better, using like CSS flex, like Flexbox and CSS Grid, and taking the best of sort of all of the new things that have come out and talking about how we can not only engineer our sites better, but we can also make them you know, more interactable and like a lighter weight sentence with, you know, the focus on mobile and that kind of thing. And it's been really interesting to see, you know, people move more towards working with CSS as more of a language even though it's not really fully language, but we're starting to, to think about its features more holistically, if that makes any sense.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
You know, seeing people use Flexbox for real, pretty much the first time that I think in 2016

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
browser's are supporting it, which is good, we can actually use it. Yeah. And

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
people starting to put out guides and like good references. And finally having the conversation about this is how we shouldn't be doing our styles.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Yeah, I think along those lines, I use six is dead, right? Like we're pretty welcome. Like calling that one dead? Yeah. And seven, and eight, and nine, and pretty much 10 as well, are all pretty much dead as well. Like most companies can feel okay, the supporting like IE 11. Enough.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think there's still a lot of people still supporting like nine and 10. I feel like that's still fairly high.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I wouldn't say there's still a lot of big enterprise easy, air quotes, financial institutions, those kind of places that have like, spent like millions of dollars building like internal web apps that happened to just only work on i Eight, and were built for it six. There's still for sure, like, amazing amount of money that it would take to convert a lot of internal apps to like work on modern browsers. But there's Enterprise Mode, there's whatever the different modes that Microsoft is still supporting.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Yeah. Which is awesome. Like, because edge ships with that, right? Yeah. So you can switch it back to IE six mode, and from what I understand that works with just about everything that needs it.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
You know, another thing that I thought of about 2016 is JavaScript education has really come a long way. I think it's, it's super easy to get started and learn JavaScript these days. And it's getting better and better. And there's so many more people putting out really, really high quality talks and high quality tutorials. I think it's it's just getting better and better.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
To piggyback off that, actually, I think that's really interesting that you brought that up, because I think people are making the developer experience better for front end. But also, it's kind of elevating front end to a new level, because it's making it easier for you know, other types of engineers to play around with front end. And to realize that, you know, front end engineering, it's not that easy. It's not so simple. And seeing like the conferences in the community, just rally around, you know, we're kind of becoming more of a thing are becoming more recognized. We've got more tools, we've got more languages, frameworks, and everything. And it's really interesting to see last year just, you know, the community become a little bit more emboldened. Before that reason people making it easier for other developers to enter is kind of elevating the community as a whole.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
I don't know what it was. But something you said that reminded me that strongly typed JavaScript now has been really big thing in 2016 that I really, really liked.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You're seeing more and more like, it's not that they're necessarily new languages, but something like TypeScript. No, it's become way more popular than 16. I think that one is, I mean, I remember looking at it years ago, but never looked at it again. And now I feel like it's popping up more and more. And I think I like it more now too.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Yeah, definitely.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
Yeah, definitely been way more accepting of it this especially this year than I ever had been before.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Same with Elm and flows. Well,

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
one trend that cheers to I think I'm not sure if I, I like it or dislike it. It's more of maybe a little bit nebulous to me is the progressive web app concept and how that kind of got a lot of play this year. And how to actually do that. I think it's a lot there's a lot of talk about it, and there's a lot of excitement about it, but there's a lot of I think Concrete. Here's how you go about doing it. I know Eddie, Eddie has money. He's done some really good talks about like, here's some frameworks. And here's some examples of how you do it. But I think you hear a lot of buzz about it. But I think like the community as a whole, the front end dev community wants a little bit more like, how, how might you go about doing that. And then the other part that's interesting to me about that is the whole code splitting progressive about like, only take, get the resources you need. And like having done web development for a really long time. It's so funny, to me, it's like this, like, full circle, like, Oh, you mean like a multi page web where you go and get only the resources you need. When you request that new page like that. It's very interesting to me to see kind of that full circle.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That's actually one that I wish we saw more progress on was just progressive web apps. I think I wish I saw a little more of it. I think there's a lot of steam behind it, but not really people actually implementing and really pushing that forward. A lot of people are talking about an excitement around it, but I just have not seen it enough, which is I would love in 2017. To see more of that.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I think we  will, I think we will

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Yeah, I'd say speaking of progressive web apps, I think 2016. For me, I saw the rise of JavaScript as being a viable alternative for an app because 2015 was very much we were wrong, we can't replace everything with a web page, go back to native and then 2016 Were like, actually React Native came along. And it's more popular. And actually, with the service workers, we can do a lot, we can actually make it a viable, like mobile app out of JavaScript. And that's something I really, really liked. Actually, we're kind of JavaScript coming full circle again, how about next year, I'll probably be down.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
This is gonna be 2017. Trend, chairs. I think web pack two was a big deal for for 2016. Going back to code splitting, and all that kind of stuff that's going to make a I don't know, the whole experience for everyone a lot better.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
What was the big change for Webpack? Two,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
it got more complicated, but it allowed things like code splitting, it allowed. I don't know there's a, there's a whole bunch of features that because you could do code splitting as well into Webpack. One, but I think he has six modules support, which then allowed for live code inclusion, or tree shaking, to be in Webpack, which is really, really cool. So you can just, you know, pull out all your code that you don't need. That's the feature I was most excited about. Because it just you get less code, you get less kilobytes for free,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
which is always a good fit. Getting into that 2g networks is a lot easier at that point for sure.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
Oh, I totally forgot to mention, yeah, Facebook hiring all the React people. And the Babel people to

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
actually you're right. Like that was all in 2016. Yeah. Early on till now.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Yeah, definitely. They got dominant Galloway, who's the inferno guy, they got James Kyle, who's the compiler guy from Babel from now on flow. Dan Abra. market this year. He's the Redux guy,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think it was this year.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I mean, I feel like I'm selling these people short by calling him like the Redux guy, right. But they're all fantastic people.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, redex was huge. I mean, I wouldn't be ashamed to be called the Redux guy for that.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I mean, the rise of Redux was meteoric. This year, I feel like this standard network to the point where to the point with Redux. We're telling people not to use it, right.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I think that's something I mean, we're jumping around here. But I think it's something you'll see in 2017 is probably less people using Redux. Honestly, I, I think it's cool. It's a great idea. But I don't think it's applications for everybody. And you can't just throw it in your app, and you're like, done. Same thing for functional program. I like and dislike it. I like functional programming, I think people should learn it, but it's not a panacea. It's like not gonna solve all your problems automatically. Just like, type JavaScript is not gonna solve all your problems. It's more, I hope to see in 2017 People just educated about what to use and when to use it. And just learn these things and know when to inject into your application. Not necessarily, you know, Ryan Burgess says use this and you're gonna use it. It's gonna like fix your company.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Obviously, it's gonna fix everything to fix everything.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Totally. That's how this all my decisions. Ryan Burgess. WebKit. Reaching 100% Yes, success here. That's pretty exciting.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Oh, totally. We haven't even touched on ESX is the fact that we're actually using it so much more. It's like

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
the the standard now, right? Oh,

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
that was the biggest surprise of 2016. Who would have thought the first browser to reach full ESX compatibility would have been Safari? Not me. Yeah, I would have bet my car on it not being still
blown away by that. Yeah, actually.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
This is WebKit. Right. Let's let's let's let's split hairs.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
But but in Safari, right, like it's full on WebKit. So they have no but it wasn't apple that did it? It was WebKit. That did Fair enough. And Safari just benefited because they chose WebKit. Yeah, not all those people work at Apple.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
That's one thing I've just liked in 2016 as having moved down here in the valley, we're you know, we're we're in Los Gatos and Netflix in Apple's in Cupertino. I literally know maybe one apple engineer. I just never see them. I never hear about It goes on. I really don't like that I didn't know he's like that mysterious until I moved out here. And I just, I've never heard an apple engineer give a talk. I've no idea what they're working on no idea what they're excited about.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It's hard. They're just that's one thing that Apple is really bad about, and maybe good at too sometimes, when I think of their hardware releases, which aren't a secret of anymore. I mean, I feel like MacRumors pretty much guesses it every single time. But I do feel like they're lacking in that in their, you know, speaking and interpreting back. Yeah, contributing back and really getting involved in the community. I completely agree. I think it's just a black box there. You have no idea what they're doing or what they're thinking.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I do know a few other engineers and like, they're phenomenal people. I think it's just that their legal departments overly cautious about a lot

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
of this stuff. It's not the engineers fault or anything, getting on that topic of dislikes. For me one thing, like, while we're on Apple, I feel like they made a lot of stupid mistakes in their hardware. I'm not a fan of the new iPhone at all. I hate that I don't have a headphone jack. And I know it's pretty minor, but it after using it for what like, you know, three or four months, it's it's pretty painful is like, you can't charge your phone and listen to music at the same time. Without an adapter. All right, fine. You know, I know someone will say

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
no, but it is a pain. Like I took my wife to the airport and I took her her Bose headphones and I like gave a tour. She was getting on the plane. She's like, I can't use these like had he didn't bring my adapter Did you like my dongle? 2017 that should have been the drinking word. Trend.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
One i What bothers me is I actually have safety tied my dongle on my expensive headphones, so that I can either plug it into my Macbook or plug it into the dongle into my phone. I looked at that thing, I'm gonna lose it like immediately. I think within the first day, I did lose it temporarily and was like, oh shit, where's this dongle, and it took me a while to find it. So after that, I'd safety tied it and it stays on the headphones.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Have any of you tried the earbuds or the?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I will say that's actually a like, for me, our coworker? No foul, he has some. And I was pretty impressed with them. I haven't actually heard the sound. So maybe that's I think they're about the same as the old earbuds. But they were super impressive in the fact that like, if I'm coming up to talk to him, he removes one out of his ear and it pauses it just by him removing it out of his ear. When he puts it back in his ear. It starts playing if you're playing from your phone, like if you're not plugged into like headphones or anything, you're just trying to play music from the speaker of the phone, and then you connect your headphones. It automatically just syncs onto your headphones. I think a lot of that I was like okay, wow, that's yeah, it was really well thought out. Especially after seeing the iPhone and the MacBook Pro. I was impressed. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
yeah, no, those don't interact. Well. No, definitely. So talking about MacBook Pros, cuz I've just been chomping at the bit for this. I fucking hate the new MacBook Pro. I'm waiting for this. I got one. Like a chump. This is the end of the line with MacBook Pros for me until they fix their shit. I'm switching to Linux. I've already ordered my new XPS. I'm putting Ubuntu on it. And I'm done with this bullshit. So I've already had kernel panics on this new laptop. I've never had a kernel panic. I didn't even know the kernel. I mean, obviously I do but I didn't know that was that they did that. And I've already had that happened to me multiple times. I have apps crashing I have the touch bar just like not showing up sometimes. Like the touch bar is an interesting cute toy. Right?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
It's not really that interesting, though.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
It's also running a whole other iOS.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Yeah, it's running like watch your friends watch runs watch us. Holy shit. I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
did not know them.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Yeah, the battery life is atrocious, at least on my 15 inch.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
On all.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
Meeting I showed up at a meeting with 100% battery. Before the hour was up. It was down to like 10 or 7% or something like that.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
It's insane. it overheats.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Like it's not a laptop anymore, because it gets hot on your lap. Yeah,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
no, it's like it's like burning potential. I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan what to do with the iPhone seven. Like I'll keep using iPhones because I'm for perfect sick. I'm not switching to Android.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You know what I still like Android. Android is good. I

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
use Android. It's it's not Android. It's not Android, the iOS the Android. The iOS is awesome. I have prom with Google. Like if you listen this podcast before you also know that I have a problem because right now I'm just getting more and more problems.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I got to join you on having I bash Apple pretty much all the time. But Mac OS is not stable. But like back in the day everybody's like use a Mac. It's bulletproof. You can't get viruses, they won't crash blah, blah, blah. Windows sucks. This thing crashes all the time. There's like weird system errors that I can't fix and nobody knows about. So you're obscure. Yeah, it's I'm not impressed honestly, for this much money. I expect a much better development machine.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
So if I burn All of your laptops right now which I'm happy tend to do. What do you switch to?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I stick with the MacBook, my old Mac my

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
old No, I burned all those ones

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I can go to like windows. I'm never going to go to Windows. Last time I touched Windows was Windows XP. So maybe it's better I know it is. It's great, but I'm not switching to it. Ubuntu Zarate, but I'm not gonna switch. I'm just not

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
okay. Does anyone else tempted?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
I guess I was flirting with a Surface Book for a while

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
window having windows 10. At home, it's not much better. Either. They just Microsoft shoves so much bloatware in there, it's like, I don't want Cortana. But they just keep shoving it. I uninstall it as best I can. And they just comes back on the desktop. It's very frustrating. It's way different

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
than Siri. Yeah, I

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
was gonna say yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Yeah, I mean, it was like a couple weeks after I got to San Francisco, my parents, like did something crazy with their computer. And I had to basically like remotely try and help them to reformat the whole thing. And it was a Windows experience. And it was so bad. Like, they tried installing Windows from scratch and like, pause it 99% for like three days straight. And I'm like, Just wait a little bit longer, a little bit longer. And then it ended up being like, oh, you should probably unplug the printer. And I bet that will fix oh my god, I never did. But that's windows and like, I just feel like that's still windows. For me.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
I don't know if it's a Windows thing. That's more the hardware thing. surface, it's integrated and made to work with Windows stuff. It's a much better experience. And if you buy a Dell with a bunch of random hardware, that's technically it should work on Windows, but probably doesn't

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
speak about hardware, that's a good good transition to things that will happen in 2017. Already know there's going to be major internet, I'll just like I already know it. There's, we saw in 2016, we saw insecure routers, all these internet connected devices are unsecured. They're talking about now malware for your Smart TV, which all TVs now pretty much are smart. Like we're we're in a lot of trouble for 2017. And a lot of security experts that I've read are just saying all the like minor outages and they were major outages but they're calling minor outages. We're just like probing attacks, to see what people could do. And when someone actually harnesses that to take down a company like we're in trouble. We just haven't invested in security. And it annoys me so much that the government just like they have all these other priorities. We have this crazy election as we know, the United States, we do have the best cyber Oh, yeah, cyber something. But yeah, he just, it's just clear, no one there really cares about cybersecurity. And I think that's to our detriment. We have a lot of smart engineers, United States, but nobody's working on security. Because

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
is that on the government, though? I mean, I get it, but is it on the government? Or is it on the manufacturers building the hardware and building the software for device? Like we talked about smart TVs? Is that on the government? Or is that on this Smart TV manufacturer?

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I think the government just has I mean, like at this point, internet is part of our infrastructure, but no one's thinking about it as part of our infrastructure. So we don't have a corresponding government body that thinks about the internet as our infrastructure like it should with highways and, and you know, like, Well, okay, medical insurance is not considered infrastructure, but it's also sort of like a national thing that's going on at the moment. And I think that that's why individual companies haven't really thought about it. But that's because we don't need someone coming down from high above saying, hey, you need to fix this, but there sort of need to be standards and procedures and someone talking about it, at least regulations, that kind of thing.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
That must be part of our foreign policy, as well, because a lot of these attacks aren't coming from United States.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Well, so we have cyber borders as much as we do have like actual physical borders, and then we won't acknowledge that so

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
so here's my thing. And Mars I agree with you 1% I think it is the government's responsibility because say Yahoo Yahoo got hacked in what 2012 or something like a billion that was a big one too. And then it turns out it was like later is bigger than they said, we're still like accountability for that. Like, this is costing people and other businesses real money. And you know, if you if you have a bank and you leave the doors in security, they get robbed, the insurance companies can come in and be like, Oh, we got you. Yeah, you know, these things happened. And of course now they're gonna slap in the face be like no, we're not paying for this. And same thing for like, companies that refuse to secure their internet devices. There should be liabilities for these things because there are real effects the internet is part of our entire culture now so you can't just be like oh are bad we we MD five to your hat. Your password are bad. We didn't know any better. Like there's no

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
password clear text and email when you forgot past. Oh, yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
That's egregious. Yeah, sorry, what else out there for my rant, but it like I'm telling you 2017 It's gonna get worse, it's gonna get much worse.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Well, I mean, like, there was the the DNS attack this year, right? It's brought down like a decent chunk of the internet. And like we haven't, as far as I know, I don't remember any attack of that scale, ever. Right.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
And that was minor that was considered a minor.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
So hopefully, the 2017 is the year of security.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I with our current administration, I doubt it.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Well, I think also, I mean, 2017 there's security and then there's policy. I think there's gonna be a lot of policy going on. Like for example, we have the internet of things that are listening and watching and Not to scare anyone but you know all the time you know? You know the Amazon Echo is always literally

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
right now is listening to us. There's an Alexa Alexa, play Bon Jovi

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
playing songs by Bon Jovi from Spotify. Did you hear? Zuckerberg got a lot of flack for his ad about Jarvis where he asked to play some Nickelback songs. I'm sorry, there's no good Nickelback song. So the wife of Nickelback lead singer lashed out at Mark.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I don't know why, but he hates Nickelback. Like they're not the world's worst band. It's just like trendy to hate them. I think that I think would be big in 2016 that didn't turn out. I think web assembly SM is not there yet. People thought it was gonna be much bigger came on like 2015 2014. But just nobody's really done

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
anything yet. It was like announced and then I think it's coming.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
But yeah, maybe it didn't happen. 2016

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
It's, it's coming together. If you watch the progress on like, their, their mailing list, it's coming together. But it's a big complicated beast. And it's something that we don't want to fuck up. Because if it fucks up, then it's gonna be another. What's IndexDB right like thing that we thought was gonna be super cool, and then ended up being like a pothole on the history of the internet superhighway. So it's coming. They're getting it right. They're introducing the the correct types that we need to make it amazing.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You know, what one that I thought we would see an end to and it definitely is a trend. Cheers. Cheers. Is parallax scrolling down with that? And it still exists? I can't stand it. I mean, there's a couple of sites that probably do okay at it, where it's done decently for a reason, but I can't think of too many. It's it's a rare case. I think people should stop using parallax scrolling, and I'm hoping in 2018, there's no more.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Yeah, no, that one's atrocious. Another one that annoyed me that still hasn't died out is like people just programming for like desktop and not programming at all for mobile. Yeah, I look at your website way more often on my mobile phone. Like if I don't have to be in front of a computer, because it's literally my my day job that I'm not

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
mobile first. I thought we've discussed this years ago, but feel like that was like 2013 Was that trend? Cheers.

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
Well, on a similar note, what really bugs me and this may not be a 2016 issue at all specific to 2016. But mobile sites or mobile apps not having the same capabilities as the desktop app. One thing, for example, is Expedia on Expedia, you can filter by pet friendly amenities, and on mobile, you can filter by amenities at all. And it is just the most annoying thing ever. And ever. Media desktop will encourage you to use the app because you get more points, but they don't have the same features anyway. So that's one example. But I've seen it time and time again, of apps and mobile sites not having the same features just desktop. And it's just doesn't quite make sense, given that we're all using mobile more than we are desktop.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
You know what I think actually adding to that in not just necessarily picking on Expedia, I think we haven't I expected to see a lot more people doing web apps, I feel like we should slowly be moving away from the mobile apps, like I feel like native apps shouldn't be as prominent as they are, if the web has gotten a lot more powerful. I shouldn't have to download an app to basically do something of like filling out a flight information or anything like that. I can log into your site, it should be mobile friendly. There's a lot of features that are there. It's not perfect, but I feel like I would like to see more web apps, not mobile native apps.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Well, one thing I hope we see in 2017, a trend, if you will. Is Apple catching up on that that front that we see ServiceWorkers, progressive web apps, all that stuff coming to Apple as well. And I think a lot of companies are waiting until that's really solid on both the Android side and the iOS side before we're actually going to see real progress on totally doing away with native apps and just landing on on Web.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I'm worried that Apple's not going to introduce them into Safari, like service workers, especially they

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
have to at some point, there's going to be enough pressure at some point that it's going to reach critical mass.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I mean, to me, it should be done sooner. I think they're trying to avoid, like a security issue, but it's not really a security issue. I'm not really sure, but I wish they should be there already.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I have my theory on this. And you know, Kalamata podcast. I can espouse it to 1000s of people, maybe millions one day, I don't think Apple support ServiceWorker. It's in their five year plan, but five years is, you know, a lifetime in front and land. I don't think they support service workers that it's not security. It's because you can make apps that are so powerful, they look and feel like native apps, but they're outside the app store and they love their walled garden. And like I respect them for that, but they stifle innovation by not doing that so I they have a while before they support ServiceWorkers. So I hope that everybody just keeps using them keeps using them and then Apple just slowly goes downhill. People are like I'm not using Safari anymore and sorry, they seem to do There's a decision they made two, three years ago. And now it's come to like, Edge supports them Chrome, Firefox, Opera,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Safari, just not so far. Yeah. It's pretty

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
sad. Well, you can do Apple Pay on the web now. I mean, that's that. I mean that that is a positive progress, right. And they are pushing. Well, they're pushing web payments in a lateral direction sort of forward, but at least they're thinking about it.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
What about Web VR? Remember that? It's been around for a couple years now. But it's still hasn't yet.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I thought it would pick up a little more steam than it has. Yeah, it hasn't.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
It's picked up some like the ones really pushing it forward. Are Mozilla right, they're the ones actually shipping different builds of Firefox that actually run on vive that run on Oculus. Like I did a couple talks this year in Iceland, and in Poland on using React Web VR. React VR was announced this year. So like, those things are kind of coming. They're interesting. And I think that one in particular is hinging on wasum. Right web assembly? Because we need you need that kind of performance in order to get VR, you know, done correctly.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
So do you think we'll see more of that in 2017?

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I think we need to see what ASTM come first. And I think we need to like really nail that first because like as someone that just bought a VR headset, if it's like laggy or jumpy, or in any way bad, you get motion sucks super fast. It's cool that it's it's a thought though that's happening. Like, you can run Google Cardboard on, you know, an everyday Safari instance, which is really cool.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
That was really cool. Anyone have any big like surprises that they had in 2016? Where they didn't expect something? And it actually happened? Not so much that like I think we talked about things that didn't turn out. But what are some things that you had no idea that would happen?

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
The thing that I was disappointed with that I wasn't necessarily expecting this there was a lot of negative energy towards open source maintainer ZZ this year. The big one of the big buck blog posts this year was dear JavaScript from James Kyle. Poor fucking James Kyle, like, I feel a lot of sympathy for him. He got shit all over. He's done amazing things with Babel with yarn with learner. The guy has been doing amazing things like don't get me wrong, like, Facebook pays me to do those kinds of things. But nonetheless, he's doing amazing things. And if he's not doing your problem, then fuck you just either wait your turn or do it yourself. Right? This is open source. That's the whole

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
point of open source is we each take a turn and do something. And if you want to see something change, make the change.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Yeah, I saw it on React router. I saw it on like all sorts of repos. Like that's what I really hope that I see curved and 2017 is that we're no we're nicer to our constituents.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
majority people do this, even if you are being paid for it. That's great. That's awesome that you're getting paid to do that open source work. But there's a roadmap to right, like they have things that they need to do. And you can't just jump on just because someone requested some feature doesn't mean you have to drop everything to do it. But especially the people that are doing this on their free time. That's that's tough. Yep. Totally. Hopefully, we see your community.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
So how do you guys? It's an interesting question, how do you feel about big open source projects? And you know, the leader is getting swallowed up by bigger corporations are getting paid to work on those? Is that a good thing for open source? Is it a bad thing?

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
It's a thing that happens? Like, I don't know, if necessary, I don't need to necessarily qualify it as good or bad. Like it happens. And react still happens, right? And I still get to use React. So I'm

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
like, Do you think any of these products are steered by the corporations that pull these people in? Or is it? Are they still free to do exactly what they wanted to do? Are they able to follow the plan that they originally had? Or does it change once they get brought in?

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I think you're fooling yourself. If you think react isn't steered by Facebook, right, like it is right? Like it's it's written to serve Facebook's purpose. If Facebook did not see benefit in existing and paying people to work on it, they wouldn't, right? Like this is not a labor of community or anything like that. This is business, right? And I just happen to benefit from their business. But that's the same as just about anything, right?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
There's benefits for having it open source, there is benefits for doing that, and allowing other companies and people to work on it. Well, now, if you want to work at Facebook, and you've been using React for a while, well, now you're actually familiar with what they're doing at Facebook, it also is a really good tool for recruiting to is like, Hey, you're using react to this, or we produce this really great product, and you want to work on this. Hey, come work with us? I think so. Yeah, I agree with you. At the end of the day, there's so many benefits for the company. But I do love that they're going to share it back to the community is like, Hey, this is what we're creating to solve our problems. If it helps you. That's awesome, use it. But if it doesn't, well, we're not going to add in all these features that don't really matter to us. Because then it bloats the framework that we're trying to create, definitely.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I think in 2016, we saw more of the, like the fragility of the open source ecosystem and that a lot of projects are maintained by like one or two people and when they drop out like you see innovation just dropped completely. And people don't know that they think these major massive projects are like backed by teams and teams of people when they're not Like, usually some person, maybe two that are really passionate about the steering. And I think we saw that just like projects just tanked. And they just got dropped and people complain like, well, you can always forked it and fix it like, No, I don't really care that much. But I totally agree to many people bashing open source, a lot of people contributing back to it

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
was open SSL problems this year. It was last year,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think it was last year 2015.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I mean, that's, that's a good example, that like one person maintaining a hugely important library, and then being super overworked and all that kind of stuff.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
I think there's like a lot of really super big, very profitable companies that should, you know, donate to open source projects, and they don't, and they make a lot of money. And they don't, and they utilize these tools to make. They're like mission critical apps for their company, and they don't contribute back at all. And I just think that's, that's also part of that issue, too. Definitely.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
We do our part with our free podcasts. Yeah.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
We do this for free on our own time we give back to the community or on booze. Booze, what are you most excited for? As we end everything we've talked about on 2016? What are you most excited for in 2017,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I'm excited to see how like the way we think of what a UI is starts to change. And I think I've seen several examples leaving in 2016, even if they're in their infancy is like React, VR came out, there's a lot of like VR, sort of test UIs coming out. And also other UI is like I saw this cool. It's like the thing you put on your finger. And it's like a new way of doing like a keyboard in the air, you can type on your phone, I don't remember what it was called. But it's just this this new new way of defining the UI, you know, either via wearables or VR, and just seeing the UI kind of extend into like, more of like, our physical space is actually really, really interesting. Or even like our, you know, digital space with VR, and you know, headsets and everything that

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
is really cool. I think we're gonna see more and more of that. Yeah, I'm interested to see if it actually picks up or not, I think I'm a little bit skeptic on how much it will get picked up. I think we're headed in the right direction. But it'll be interesting to see how much of a reality it actually is.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I'm excited and hopeful that the front end as a community, we turn kind of a lot of the negativity of 2016, like we saw with Brexit, and the election is just kind of a lot of hate going on that we turn that into empathy. And we start building better applications that work in developing countries, and we just, we just have more empathy, because we can we absolutely have the capability to kind of shape how the web is because that's what we do we build the web make it better for everyone. Exactly. We I think of any people in history, we have the most power to change, like what's going to happen, what's the narrative of the internet, and hopefully, we do something. So I'm pretty excited about that. 2017

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I'm actually one thing I'm excited for. And it's probably like a stretch is starting to see people rethink some CSS. And I'm still skeptical that will actually come into place, as we've seen with like, sass. And last that was a great that was like people can use ideas more,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
it'll be great. Don't listen. Failure.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
But it's true. What is the last major leap we've seen in like CSS, thinking of how we architect our applications, you know, there was smacks back in the day there was a bee. But I don't think there's been any kind of innovation in that area in quite some time.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I think the closest thing would probably be post CSS, right? That's been the most interesting thing that's happened in a while. Yeah, that

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
definitely changed a few things. But I still don't think it's as like it's evolutionary,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
not revolutionary. Exactly. I think Houdini, like, that's something I'm really excited about.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
I think that's a great step CSS, a huge one,

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
that one's gonna be, it's gonna be revolutionary, because it's going to allow us, the developer to invent new features, which may or may not make it into the browser eventually, right? It's the babble of CSS for us, right? We get to do new exciting stuff that we couldn't do before. And I

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
think that's what will push CSS forward, is being able to do it like a babel approach. Yeah, the community gets to push it for it, exactly. Any other things you're excited about.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
And the one thing that I'm not excited about, is I'm really worried about like, our rights on the internet, like privacy, about net neutrality, about data retention laws, and all that kind of thing. Like we're seeing some crazy laws coming out of the US coming out of the UK. And so I think a lot of this stuff is going to fall to us, the developers to kind of determine how our company operates. Because like, I don't think your CEO is going to come to us, like, make sure we're not keeping IP addresses, right. So it's gonna fall to us a developer to say, like, I don't need to have this information on hand. So if I'm just going to drop it on the floor, unless I absolutely require it right. And you, as the developer are required to make those kind of decisions. So the government can't ask you for something you don't have. Right. So that's something I'm worried about. But I'm hopeful that developer is going to make the right decision on those kinds of subjects.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I'm excited to see tech companies kind of just do better. Alright, in 2016 they did pretty good like as a as a whole Yeah. It was our own kind of echo chamber of San Francisco. Yeah, of San Francisco and the West and the coastal states. But I think in 2017, we're excited to see more companies push back, like Slack is doing a really good job of diversity. I know Netflix is big on like culture and inclusion. There's a lot of good tech tech companies, I forget the president of Salesforce, but like, he's really like, he really pushes agendas, which do it, you know, like, people are gonna push agendas anyway, so we might as well have a positive impacts. So I hope to see more of that 20 Somethings

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
companies can make a pretty big impact to you. I think that's the thing too, is that you have all these people using our products that we're building and we can make a pretty big difference and so why not make a difference and make it better?

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
I think one of the AVI I work at Netflix, but so I'll say I think one of the big things for even net neutrality was Netflix is like no, we're not gonna pay you more. And like they taking that stand really changed the internet for the next couple years. And I You're right, it's coming back. And they keep trying to like, creep back in there. So I mean, Sue and Raul have gigabit internet. So we need to kind of push a little harder as a vocal community and be like, No, we're not gonna pay more because I want to watch this. That's ridiculous.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
All right. As we wrap up today's episode, let's share some pics of things that we have found interesting to share. Let's grow on the table and share the pics for today's episode. Bars. You want to start it off? Sure,

</p>
<p><strong>Mars Jullian</strong><br />
I'll start off with two newsletters that I found actually pretty useful this year. One is called the React status newsletter. And the other is the front end focus newsletter. And they just have really interesting links to new projects to new trends.

Just kind of cool stuff that people are doing in the community that's either getting a lot of hype or isn't is it's kind of just needs a little bit of light. So I found this really interesting.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
I have two picks today. First one is an album from Run The Jewels are TJ three, it's my album of the year. I love it. That's amazing album, you should go check it out. And then my second pick is going to be an alternative to bash. Bash is great. I use bash forever. But I started using fish, which is a different shell. And I'm kind of in love with it. It's kind of a pain sometimes because you have to like make sure that you're interrupting every time with bash but from when for every other instance. It's it's super awesome. I've really enjoyed it great jam on.

</p>
<p><strong>Jem Young</strong><br />
My first pick is a Netflix Original called travelers. It was kind of low budget sci fi but I binge watched that thing for the whole show very quickly. And it's probably one of my favorite shows of 2016. Wow. Yeah, I and everybody. Everybody that knows me knows I'm very critical of movies and TV shows. And my second pick was actually all the listeners we met in 2016. It's been incredible just doing his podcast with everybody. And we met a lot of people all around the world that they'll be like, Hey, you're on front and happy. I love that. You know, I'm in Europe. And it's so cool. Just you know, reaching out and meeting people from around the world. And even now to say it's made a lot of good friends this year.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
Who knew that people would listen to it? Random my biggest surprise

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
that should be my my last pick is gems shower thoughts,

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
which we need to bring that back.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
Alright, some of my picks. The first one is nuclide or a teammate of mine mentioned that it might be a cool add on for Adam to we do some stuff of flow and we do some stuff with React. And there's a lot of built in like niceties inside of there, type ahead type checking all that kind of stuff like in line. So that was pretty cool. I'm just starting to check it out. And I like it so far. And then yarn. We talked about that earlier in episode. And I just right now, there's more benefits than that I mentioned. But the speed thing to me was huge.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
So my first pick is Vim plugin called vim dev icons. And what this does is just puts the icon of the file type you're editing, or looking at in nerd tree or command P.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Does it work in Sublime? Uh, no, no, I found it because I'm just kidding.

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
So the reason I was looking for this, and I made it my pick is because that really bothered me when I switched from Adam to Vim. I didn't have that. Okay, I used a theme and Adam that had it and I was really bothering me on why why it's important to me, but it just is and it just looks nice.

</p>
<p><strong>Brian Holt</strong><br />
Does it bother you more than fingerprints on your screen?

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
Nothing. And my second one is podcast from the Runner's World Magazine. And I just stumbled onto this the other day, and I wasn't quite sure what to make of a podcast about running but it actually was really entertaining and I really enjoyed it and I listened to almost all the back episodes already. So from one podcast to another is a really good, a really enjoyable so

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
how many episodes are there

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Anklam</strong><br />
20 Something

</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burgess</strong><br />
not bad. Alright, I have two picks for us this episode as well. One is a gift that my wife got me is called the electric objects frame. It's actually something that Jem had suggested and great, great gift is you can actually display Art in a digital frame. And it's like a large frame. It's not like your little tiny picture frames that you put on a desk or anything like that. And so it's actually made me recreate a bunch of art that I've done in the years past using Illustrator files. So I've really enjoyed it, we're actually displaying right now as a front end, Happy Hour logo right now. So that's pretty badass, you can change whatever you're displaying. And then my second pick going along with the theme of today, is we all really enjoy conferences. And I've always really struggled with trying to find all the different conferences that are for the year. So I've created a list of 2017 conference lists. It's on my GitHub, so I guess it's a bit self serving to promote that. But honestly, I created it to try and make everyone else's life easier. Because there's so many great conferences out there and definitely worth checking it out. Definitely. Sarah Dresner has one two on CSS tricks. Yes, her and I were like, collaborating on between the two is like she was looking at mine. I was looking at hers. And we're like, oh shit, there's some that we don't have. And so we both grabbed from each other, which is good, because I feel like it's hard to find all the list of conferences that are out there for sure.

</p>
<p><strong>Stacy London</strong><br />
