          Welcome to Front End Happy Hour! Weâ€™re a podcast where a group of front end developers
          discuss a range of topics pertaining to front end development, while enjoying a few
          drinks. Each episode, we have a casual discussion about front end development, technology,
          and the culture of programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our panelists include engineers from companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, Atlassian, and
          Evernote. We also occasionally have guests from other companies join our discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope you enjoy the show! Cheers!
